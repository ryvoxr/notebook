From: [[Three Scientific Principles of Sustainability]]

The circulation of chemicals necessary for life from the environment through [[Organism|organisms]] and back into the [[Environment|environment]]

This means that there is little waste in nature because the wastes of any organism become nutrients or raw materials for other organisms
