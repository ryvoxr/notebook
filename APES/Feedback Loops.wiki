== Positive Feedback Loop ==
Causes a system to change further in the same direction

Vegetation removed from stream valley -> flowing water causes erosion and loss of nutrients -> more vegetation dies

== Negative feedback loop ==
Causes a system to change in the opposite direction from which it is moving

Recycling
- Aluminum doesn't need to be mined if it's able to be recycled
- Reduces impact on environment

Sun causes plants to grow -> plants burn into CO2  that blocks sun -> plants grow less

== Eutrophication ==
Over-fishing oysters results in a decrease of oysters
Less oysters to reduce algal blooms
Algal bloom create dead zones
Dead zones kill oysters
