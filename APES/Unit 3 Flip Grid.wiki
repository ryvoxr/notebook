*Discuss the positive aspects of living a vegetarian lifestyle in terms of the second law of thermodynamics and all the environmental benefits achieved.*
- Due to the second law of thermodynamics, only around 10% of energy passes on
- If you eat higher, you thus take more energy
- If you eat lower, less energy
- Benefits: less water used, less livestock emissions, less agriculture needed

*Discuss the interaction of the nitrogen cycle in human activities in fishing, farming, and other industries.*
- Burning fossil fuels releases nitrogen
- Increased use of nitrogen-based- fertilizers

*Aquatic ecosystem changes*
- Fertilizer runoff: seeps out of the soil and into drinking water or waterways | can cause eutrophication

*How are eutrophication and photosynthesis tethered to the N,P, and C cycles and include one positive feedback loop that integrated with this relationship.*
An excess of Nitrogen or Phosphorus from runoff can cause eutrophication. Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide to work.
