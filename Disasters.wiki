# Disaster Presentations

### Love canal
Neighborhood in Niagara falls, New York
- Created as a model planned community
- Became a dumping site for chemicals from a chemical company
- Started dumping byproducts: perfumes, rubber into canal

Caused health issues

Solution: destroyed neighborhood instead of cleaning up operation

### Shrinking of the Aral Sea
- Began shrinking when the Soviet Union began digging irrigation channels
- Soviets were trying to grow crops in a desert climate
	- Very poorly built
- Vase majority of wildlife is dead
	- Biological weapons test

Locales inhale toxic dust

Attempting to stabilize the environment
- Farmers rely on the water that comes from the irrigation system

### Dust Bowl
During the Great Depression, people needed to plant and harvest food

There was a extended drought
- Heavy wind, erosion, plowing the same soil
- Led to dying crops
	- Worsened the great depression

Affected Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma

Soil Erosion Service and Prairies States Forestry Project programs were established
- Planting trees, rotating crops, ceasing the overgrazing of land


### Toxic London Fog 1952
Caused by industrial pollution and high-pressure weather conditions
- Resulted in a 5 day period of smog

All wand and water transportation was halted
- Lethal to elderly people, children, and people with respiratory issues
- 12000 deaths

Parliament passed the Clean Air Act of 1956
- Transitioned from coal to oil and electricity

### Three Mile Island 1979
Semi-meltdown was caused by pressure valve closing
- Contaminated cooling water drained into nearby buildings

Raised radiation levels caused the evacuation of 100,00 residents

Lowered trust in nuclear power

### Chesapeake Bay Dead-Zone
Caused by large amounts of algae dying
- Algae sinking to the bottom and decomposing
- No oxygen-suffocated oxygen

Harmed the ecosystem and killed wildlife

Solutions:
- Trees are being planted
	- Act as a buffer for erosion/runoff

### Flint Michigan Water Supply
The oil in the city of Flint started using lead-poisoned water from Flint River
- Led to extreme sickness within the residents of Flint Michigan

Root Causes:
1. Water testing is often overlooked
2. Lead pipes are used to supply water

Solutions:
- Bottled water service
- Funding of filters in home sinks
- Replacement of lead pipes

### Coral Bleaching
Coral is bleached from exposure to sunlight, temperature, and pollution
- Coral turns white and increases chance of death

Coral reefs provide food, habitats, and protection
- 25% of marine life depends on coral reefs during some time during their lifetime

We can prevent bleaching by
- Less fertilizers
- Dispose of trash
- Using environmental friendly modes of transportation
- Reduce storm water runoff


### Gulf Oil Spill
Oil was spilled into the Persian Gulf
- Saudi Arabian beaches had oil penetration
- 100,000 animals were killed

To prevent events like this, the use of oil spills should never be used as a defense mechanism in war

### Pacific Garbage Patch
Fishing nets were half of the mass of the patch.
- Marine animals and plants are being heavily impacted
	- Toxins from plastics are being washed into rivers, streams, and lakes
		- Consumed by animals every day

### Cuyahoga River Fire
Polluted by debris
- 20 minute fire
- Debris was caused by industrial waste
- $50,000 in railroad damages ($400,000 today)

Implement programs to watch pollution
- Clean Water Act of 1972

### Electronic Graveyard
E-waste is dumped into a "graveyard"
- Pollutes water and air
- Local residents agriculture and wetlands are devastated by the environment

Authorities banned people from burning plastic
- Stricter regulations

### Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
Largest marine oil spill in history
- Huge oil rig in Mexico exploded and sunk

Caused by improper construction of an oil well
- Water was closed for fishing
- Gulf area was polluted with oil

National efforts have been coordinated to help with the clean-up process
- Use of dispersants and manually cleaning the shorelines


### Ocean Acidification
Surface ocean waters have decreased by 0.1 pH
- More Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere
- Shell builders such as coral and corals are affected

Further ocean acidification can be prevented by decreasing CO2 commissions

### Black Triangle
Border regions shared by Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic

Extremely high levels of pollution:
- air pollution, acid rain, water pollution

Caused by energy hungry factories neraby
- Destroyed forests and had a lasting impact on the health and life expectancy of residents

### Minamata Bay
Cats were acting strangely
- Mercury poisoning
	- Brain damage, tremors, deformities
	- Affecting their nervous system

Petrochemical plant was dumping mercury compound into the Minamata Bay
- Poisoning their food and water supply

### DDT
Used for insect control in the 1960s
- Control disease
- In homes, livestock, crop and agricultural products
- Was very effective at first

Increase of insects lead to many problems across many industries

DDT caused problems in humans
- Also DDT accumulation in animals

Banned DDT & more environmentally friendly insecticides

### Great Chinese Famine
One of the deadliest famines and largest man-made disasters
- 15-55 million peopled dead
- Due to policies put in place by the Chinese Communist Party

### Nile Perch Lake Victoria
35 Nile perches were released in Lake Victoria in the 1960s
- Population quickly increased
	- Caused more than 200 species to go extinct

Nile perch preyed on many species
- Fisherman variety decreased
- Ecosystem was broken in lake Victoria

Commercial fishing is the only way to limit the population growth of nile perch

### Roane County Tennessee Coal Ash
A Dam ruptured
- 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry released into river
- Slurry also covered 300 acres of surrounding land

Lots of pressure put on the damn by coal ash
- No injuries or deaths

Barriers were put up to stop the ash
- 6 months -> only 3% cleaned up
- Costed over 1 billion to clean up
- Ecosystems did not return to prior conditions for 7 years
