= Energy Concepts =

joule (J) | Watt (W)
---|---
1 kJ = 1000 J | 1 W = 1 J/s  
1 cal = 4.184 J | 1 kW = 1000 W
1 kcal = 1000 cal |
1 BTU = 1055 J |
1 therm = 100000 BTU |
1 kWh = 3,600,000 J |

[[Energy]] is the ability to do work or transfer heat

Comes in two forms
- Potential Energy
	- Could be stored in chemical bonds
- Kinetic Energy
	- Electricity
	- Joules/kJ

[[Thermodynamics]]: Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred
- Loss of energy due to heat
	- Increases entropy of the world

Power is the amount of energy used in a given amount of time
- Watts/kWh
