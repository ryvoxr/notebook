== [[Energy Pollution]] ==

== Energy Terms ==
===== Energy conservation =====

===== Energy efficiency =====
- Making energy do more
	- Better gas mileage, appliances, light bulbs, insulation etc.

===== Energy waste =====
- Second law of [[Thermodynamics]]
- Some end up wasting more than others
- Some natural waste
- Some avoidable with care

===== Energy production =====
- All but solar panels make turbines turn
	- Generator converts turning axle to electricity
	- Car engines change explosions in piston into moving axle

===== Energy transport =====
- Moving energy source to processing to where it is needed
- Longer the move, more energy lost
