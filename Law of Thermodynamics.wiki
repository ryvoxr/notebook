# Law of [[Thermodynamics]]

## 1st law of conservation of energy
Whenever energy is converted from one form to another in a physical or chemical change, **no energy is created or destroyed**

## 2nd law of conservation of energy
When energy is converted from one form to another in a physical or chemical change, we end up with **lower-quality or less usable** energy than we started with. Entities move to a more chaotic (Higher entropy) less organized, lower energy
