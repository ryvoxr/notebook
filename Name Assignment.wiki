Hello! My name is Henry Oehlrich.

The thing that makes me proud to be called Henry is this wikipedia article. It
is titled a "List of rulers named Henry". This article is **long**.

Starting with the Brits, we have the usual suspects: Henry the I of England,
Henry the II of England. Then, we have Henry the *Young King*, and Henry the
III of England.

Now, once we get to Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, things get interesting
with the dukes. From Saxony, we have Henry the Fowler, Henry the Proud, Henry
the Lion. From Bavaria, we have Henry the Quarrelsome, Henry the Younger, Henry
the Saint, and 14 more.

The spelling of my last name, Oehlrich, derives from a more common spelling:
Ulrich. This spelling is used by the likes of Lars Ulrich (which makes me very
happy.) Lars Ulrich is obviously drummer and co-founder of the American metal
band Metallica.

Along with distantly connecting my name to famous people, I enjoy programming,
speedcubing, reading Tolkien, and listening to Rush.
