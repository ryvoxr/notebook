= "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson =

Every society has traditions and pieces of culture that seem inhumane or cruel to another culture. This theme is explicated in "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson by exploring a fictional example of this foreign, "inhumane" culture.
- Old Man Warner is a stereotypical old, traditional person. He believes that culture is vital to a society. He describes people who would like to give up the lottery as a "Pack of crazy fools"
- "Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones"
	- Some traditions are followed blindly by a "mob mentality"
- There seems to be no legal enforcement of The Lottery. It is purely tradition
