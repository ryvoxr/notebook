# Salinity

Powerful solvent: salts break apart into ions when in water
- circulates salts and other chemicals
	- Salts are two ions bonded ionic

Salinity: total amount of dissolved solid material in water
- Measured in parts per thousand (ppt)

Measured by conductivity tester
- Tells how much electricity goes through

[[Freshwater]] 2% of water | less than 2 ppt
[[Brackish water]] 2-25 ppt
[[Salt water]] most water | over 25% ppt

Thermohaline circulation
- Circulates the oceans slowly
	- Mixing every 100 years
- Driven by temperature
Density: sinking
Organisms: [[Osmosis||osmosis]]
[[Ions]]: needed by living things

Sea water average 35 ppt

Top four ions and %
- Cl - 55%
- Na+ - 31%
- SO4 -2 - 7.5%
- Mg +2 - 4%

Processes that decrease seawater salinity:
1. Precipitation
2. Runoff
3. Icebergs melting
4. Sea ice melting

Processes that increase seawater salinity:
1. Sea ice forming
	- Salt exclusion
2. Evaporation
