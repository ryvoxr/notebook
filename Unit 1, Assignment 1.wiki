= Unit 1, Assignment 1 =

=== 1. How does the author define the “master narrative”? ===
- "A narrative of nation building and unending progress that united the diverse participants in the country's past in a single American "experience""
- The master narrative was a national success story
	- Celebrated human triumphs
	-  Society based on principles of liberty and equality

=== 2. How does the story of Native Americans relate to that master narrative? ===
- The story of Native Americans was part of a group of stories that was dismissed or ignored by American historians because it did not fit the "master narrative"
- The Native American story during the nation building of America was one of decline and suffering instead of progress and the pursuit of happiness
- When the Indians' story was told in the context of the master narrative, it was portrayed as one of resistance to civilization
	- In the movies, Indian history was a sequence of hostile interactions to Euro-American settlers
	- Sometimes told as the attempts of the federal government to solve the "Indian problem"
	
=== 4. How did/does the issue of sources impact our understanding or lack of understanding of Native American history? ===
- 50 years ago, few colleges or universities offered courses in American Indian history or Native American studies
	- Because of this, we have much fewer years of study to draw upon to further our understanding of their culture
	- Even after reexamining the Native American past, they tended to focus on "Indian policies" adopted by colonial governments and the United States
		- Was written from non-Indian sources and perspectives
		
=== 5. What do we know about Native American societies, what do we not know? Why? ===
- Native American history is more than a mirror image of United States history
	- It is part of a "shared past"
- Native American societies existed long before Columbus reached the continent in 1492
	- Indian history did not end when they stopped fighting
- European invasions changed the world Indian peoples inhabited
	- The biological disasters had large consequences in Native American societies
- Many things are not known because modern scholars have a innate distrust of non written work
	- To understand more we must become "literate" in reading sources in alternate formats
		- Pictographs, winter counts, calendars, ledger art, oral traditions
	- Nicholas Perrot spent a lot of his life with the Native Americans of the Great Lakes
		- His trust in writing more than oral tradition prevented him from appreciating their culture and accurately recounting and preserving their history
		
=== 6. What do we lose if we exclude Native peoples from our study of U.S. History? In other words, why does the critique of the “master narrative” matter for us, in 2021? ===
If we exclude Native peoples from our study of U.S. History, we cannot achieve a wide understanding of the United States. This is because the histories and peoples of the U.S. are intertwined and dependent on each other. It is impossible to fully understand one without also recognizing and studying the other.
