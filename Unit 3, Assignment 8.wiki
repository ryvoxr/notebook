- John Jacob Astor and Robert Oliver first millionaires

First millionaires needed capital
- Before the American Revolution, they relied on credit from Britain
- In 1781, the Confederation Congress chartered the Bank of North America in Philadelphia
	- Traders in Boston and New York soon founded similar institutions to raise and loan money

Federalists in Congress charted the Bank of the United States
- The bank had branches in 8 cities
- Profits that gained 8% annually
- Clients with easy access to money
- "the foundations of our houses are laid in bank paper"

==== Panic of 1819 ====
Bad banking policies brought about the Panic of 1819
- American imports of English goods spiked
- In 1818 there was an abrupt 30% drop in world agricultural prices

==== Turnpikes and Canals ====
