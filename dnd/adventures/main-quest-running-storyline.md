# Main Quest Running Storyline

They see a meteor streak across the sky and land southeast of Bywater.
- Meteor has special ore inside of it
- Red malchite

The Lord Mayor Damien stops them as they leave the crash site
- Is followed by several semi-professional looking guards as well as two guys
  dressed in all black (Lugzan)
    - Can't see the black clad peoples faces
    - They don't talk
- Interrogates them, but in a really charming and naive way
    - Very kindly asks what they were doing
    - Knows that the meteor crashed there
    - Lets them go no matter what

Ulbric has a toilet problem
- Sends the halfling Yeldarb to go work for Haldir (the blacksmith)

## Encounters to happen

When the party goes back to the blacksmith, they find the blacksmith injured and
the Lugzan are hiding in the shadows (heh)
- Combat (most likely). Yaaaay!
- Haldir can't remember much
    - He remembers people wearing black break down his door, come inside, and
      then they threw him against the wall

Meets a halfling that is throwing leaves on the players heads continuously
- Halfing is very silly
- This is the Necromancer in disguise spying on them

## Red Malchite

**Flavor Text**
The ore has a deep, lustrous red color; reminiscent of ruby. The deep black of
the surrounding meteor can be seen sprinkled throughout it. Most curious of
all, though, is it's sound: emanating from seemingly within the rock, a
constant, high pitched, ringing can be heard. You can also feel an intense heat
coming from the rock.

Properties:
- Red
- Magical, arcane
- Cannot be identified by anyone in the party
- Quite hot

Not many people know what it is, so it's not very valuable

Can be combined with other metals to form an alloy. Will give flaming
- Flaming: Your weapon catches fire and deals 1d4 fire damage on a successful attack roll.


## Long term overview

The Necromancer (BBEG) has the Mayors of Esgaroth and Bywater under his
control. He scared the mayor of Esgaroth into helping him, but the Bailiff of
Bywater just had to be asked nicely. He spies on them using bats and uses
Shadow and Wraith servants (the Lugzan) to send messages and ensure his work is
complete. The Necromancer is using the manpower of Bywater and Esgaroth to
extract as much of the Red Malchite as possible in order to arm his army of
undead.
