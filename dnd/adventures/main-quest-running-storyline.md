# Main Quest Running Storyline

They see a meteor streak across the sky and land southeast of Bywater.
- Meteor has special ore inside of it
- Red malchite

The Lord Mayor Damien wants this stuff

## Red Malchite

**Flavor Text**
The ore has a deep, lustrous red color; reminiscent of ruby. The deep black of
the surrounding meteor can be seen sprinkled throughout it. Most curious of
all, though, is it's sound: emanating from seemingly within the rock, a
constant, high pitched, ringing can be heard. You can also feel an intense heat
coming from the rock.

Properties:
- Red
- Magical, arcane
- Cannot be identified by anyone in the party
- Quite hot

Not many people know what it is, so it's not very valuable

Can be combined with other metals to form an alloy. Will give flaming
- Flaming: Your weapon catches fire and deals 1d4 fire damage on a successful attack roll.
