# Ulbric's Mine

**Overview:**
Ulbric Goldtooth comes to The White Dragon (Tavern) looking for adventurers to
help him reclaim Rockhollow Cavern (his mine) that has been overrun by goblins.

**Primer:**
Ea; the world you live in. Full of continents, oceans, and islands. Distant
lands: many foreign, but one you know as home: Middengeard (midden-gard).
The world has changed. The rise and fall of empires, the slow creep of the
forests. Ancient wars long forgotten were fought here. Much that once was is
lost. For none now live who remember it.

You all have found your way here: in the year 2112, on the 23rd day of the 9th
month. In Bywater, a town just to the east of the large city Esgaroth.
Known for its sizable shipping capacity and inexplicable wealth of gold,
Bywater is one of the fastest growing, but also most dangerous, towns on this
side of Malas.

Either looking for work, information, or just needing a drink, each of you have
found your way to The White Dragon (Tavern)

**Ulbric Arrives:**
A rather intimidating looking dwarf enters the tavern,.

"What does it take to find some goddamn muscle in this town?"

"Wait, **You** *point*, **you** look like you could meet a Beholder's gaze. Who
are you."
