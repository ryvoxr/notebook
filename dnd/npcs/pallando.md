# Pallando

Wizard, rather blue

"Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."

Pallando is a really tall elf. He stands maybe 7 feet tall, the blue cartoonist
hat doesn't help. In fact, he's dressed in all blue: blue robes, blue hat - he
has blue eyes

Can offer help about Red Malchite
- Not from Middengeard
- Of magical quality
- Quite hot
- Might be able to be combined with other metals and the correct catalyst to form an alloy
