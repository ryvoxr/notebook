# Ulbric Goldtooth
### Dwarf

**Flavor Text:**
He stands about 4ft high and 4ft wide. Sporting a grizzly mane of silvery grey
hair that nearly reaches the floor. He's dressed in gold-lined maroon robes;
it's impossible to tell where his torso ends and his legs begin.

**Background:**
Ulbric is a dwarven miner mining in [[Rockhollow Cavern]]

Says **"You"** a whole lot
- eg: "Who are **You**"
