# Rockhollow Cavern

**Flavor Text:**
As you arrive at the cave, you find a deprecated doorway. One that had clearly
been used to make a hasty retreat: the door is open and there is a extinguished
torch laying on the ground.

## 1

## 2

**Flavor Text:**
Peering through the door, you can just barely make out the shadowy (black and
white) outline of the back wall. Several jagged pillars of stone cut through
the otherwise seemingly empty space. Water drips rhythmically from small
stalactites.

Wait for a bit
- 4 goblins ambush them
- The goblin that escaped went and organized an ambush
- Fight the goblins???

## 3

**Flavor Text:**
Stepping through the jagged entrance, it is clear you are now officially in
Ulbric's mine: extinguished torches hang on iron mounts nailed into the smooth
stone walls.

Find a dead goblin carcass around halfway through
- Can loot a dagger, and a spiked metal belt

Either go into room 4 or room 5

## 4

**Flavor Text:**
This room was clearly an occasional sleeping spot for Ulbric. The place seems
to be ransacked. The blanket is torn, the mattress ripped up, the items on the
shelves spilled to the floor.

Can find a few silver pieces under the bed
- The goblins weren't very smart

## 6

**Flavor Text:**
As you round the corner, you find yourself in a small room. On the far side,
you see a forge inset in an outcropping in the smooth stone walls. Two
passageways lead to the left; and two to the right. You see weapons neatly
leaning against the wall. While you're taking all of this in, a sword appears
swiftly at your throat.

**Tarondor Flavor Text:**
The sword is held by a *very* tall man. He has long, shoulder-length brown hair
accompanied by a full beard. He wears long, dark adventurer's clothing. He's
grinning at youâ€” he seems to be enjoying this.

"You're quiet for a *insert race here*, I only heard every step you took down
that hallway."

Main points to hit:
- Name is Tarondor
- Man from Esgaroth
- Noticed that goblins had infiltrated the place, came here to see if they left
  anything
- Got here earlier today -> through the main entrance
    - There was a mishap with the door
- Been holding this position for a while trying to figure out how to defeat the
  Rust Monster
- And btw there is a Rust Monster
