# Rockhollow Cavern

**Flavor Text:**
As you arrive at the cave, you find a deprecated doorway. One that had clearly
been used to make a hasty retreat: the door is open and there is a extinguished
torch laying on the ground.

## 2

**Flavor Text:**
Peering through the door, you can just barely make out the shadowy (black and
white) outline of the back wall. Several jagged pillars of stone cut through
the otherwise seemingly empty space. Water drips rhythmically from small
stalactites.

Wait for a bit
- 4 goblins ambush them
- The goblin that escaped went and organized an ambush
- Fight the goblins???

## 3

**Flavor Text:**
Stepping through the jagged entrance, it is clear you are now officially in
Ulbric's mine: extinguished torches hang on iron mounts nailed into the smooth
stone walls.

Find a dead goblin carcass around halfway through
- Can loot a dagger, and a spiked metal belt

Either go into room 4 or room 5

## 4

**Flavor Text:**
This room was clearly an occasional sleeping spot for Ulbric. The place seems
to be ransacked. The blanket is torn, the mattress ripped up, the items on the
shelves spilled to the floor.

Can find a few silver pieces under the bed
- The goblins weren't very smart
