# The White Dragon (Tavern)

**Flavor Text:**
It is a large, cavernous wooden room; light emanates from fireplaces and
lanterns filling the room with a warm golden glow. The tavern is busy, but not
full yet: it is only dusk and people are still steadily arriving. Looking at
the main bar at the front, you see a gaggle of people talking, laughing,
eating, and, most importantly, drinking.
