**Most students choose their intended major or area of study based on a passion
or inspiration that’s developed over time – what passion or inspiration led you
to choose this area of study? (300)**

During my childhood, I was always curious and questioned everything around me.
I would constantly ask 'why', and even after receiving an answer, I would
persistently continue to inquire 'why' again and again. This cycle would only
end when my parents grew weary or the line of questioning became circular. As I
matured, my incessant questioning grew into a yearning of understanding the
reasons behind things. I remeber as a kid sitting on my bed taking my alarm
clock apart and putting it back together over and over again trying to figure
out how it worked.

When I started using Linux, I began to attempt to understand how a computer
really works.

Computer is big clok

From a young age programming was very satisfying to me. The computer does
exactly what I tell it to do, no more and no less. Every function or type from
a library or language was written in code by someone else; code that I can run,
look at, and understand. 

To me, nothing is more beautiful than a piece of software, physical device, or
other solution that does one thing and does it well; I appreciate good
engineering. Throughout my experience, I've written over half a million lines
of code (literally), led engineering of a First Robotics Competition Team, and
competed at a national level in Science Olympiad building events. I know
firsthand how difficult it is to create something that works well, let alone
something that withstands the test of time. When I look at projects like
GNU/Linux, git, vim, see a really good website, or read about all the crazy
things people are doing with cache optimization, I am enamored. I chose
Computer Science as my area of study because I'm in love with understanding how
things work and want building great things.

**Many students pursue college for a specific degree, career opportunity or
personal goal. Whichever it may be, learning will be critical to achieve your
ultimate goal. As you think ahead to the process of learning during your
college years, how will you define a successful college experience? (300)**

Successful college experience:
- Establish a group of friends consisting of both like-minded and different individuals
- Narrow my studies on the thing that interests me most: computer science & distributed systems
- Gain the skills, knowledge, and experience in order to enter the workforce

My primary goal in college is to gain the skills, knowledge, and experience
necessary to enter the workforce in the field of Computer Science. I have
chosen college over its alternatives because college allows me to narrow my
studies on the specific aspects of the larger field that interest me most. I
would define a successful college experience as one that prepares me to enter
the workforce, assists me in finding what engages me most, and provides me the
opportunity to discover as much as possible about that.

**Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to
emphasize about your application for the admission committee’s consideration?
Highlight something that’s important to you or something you haven’t had a
chance to share. Tell us, don’t show us (no websites please). (300)**

Free software
- understanding how it works
- building it yourself
- ethics
- jaded with modern tech

Throughout my application, I have written extensively about my love of computer
science and my programming experience. Here I wish to share a bit of my
personal philosophy and ethical code related to computers, software, and the
world.

Free software is important to me and to many others in my field. As defined by
the Free Software Foundation, "free software means that users have the freedom
to run, edit, contribute to, and share the software". Free software is "free as
in speech, not free as in beer.
