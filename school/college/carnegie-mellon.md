**Most students choose their intended major or area of study based on a passion
or inspiration that’s developed over time – what passion or inspiration led you
to choose this area of study? (300)**

I'm seven years old and it's ten at night, way past my bedtime. I'm sitting on
the edge of my bed, screwdriver in hand, with the pieces of my partially
disassembled alarm clock neatly layed on my comforter. This isn't the first
time I've taken apart my alarm clock tonight. Seven year-old me would tear
apart Nerf guns, lightsabers, Rubik's cubes, anything of the sort trying to
figure out how it worked.

In fourth grade, my parents signed me up for a lego robotics camp at my school.
Now instead of taking apart my toys, I was able to build contraptions of my own
and design them to accomplish specific tasks. For the remainder of elementary
and middle school, I competed on my schools First Lego League team at the
highest level (in middle school 20 and 30 hour weeks were common). I loved the
ability 

1. Love to understand how things work
2. Also love to make things
3. The computer was a thinker. Very magical.
4. Programmed things
5. Dug through the layers of abstraction
6. Understood the computer
7. Wrote things using this understanding at a variety of layers of abstraction

**Many students pursue college for a specific degree, career opportunity or
personal goal. Whichever it may be, learning will be critical to achieve your
ultimate goal. As you think ahead to the process of learning during your
college years, how will you define a successful college experience? (300)**

Successful college experience:
- Establish a group of friends consisting of both like-minded and different individuals
- Narrow my studies on the thing that interests me most: computer science & distributed systems
- Gain the skills, knowledge, and experience in order to enter the workforce

My primary goal in college is to gain the skills, knowledge, and experience
necessary to enter the workforce in the field of Computer Science. I have
chosen college over its alternatives because college allows me to narrow my
studies on the specific aspects of the larger field that interest me most. I
would define a successful college experience as one that prepares me to enter
the workforce, assists me in finding what engages me most, and provides me the
opportunity to discover as much as possible about that.

**Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to
emphasize about your application for the admission committee’s consideration?
Highlight something that’s important to you or something you haven’t had a
chance to share. Tell us, don’t show us (no websites please). (300)**
