**Most students choose their intended major or area of study based on a passion
or inspiration that’s developed over time – what passion or inspiration led you
to choose this area of study? (300)**

I'm seven years old and it's ten at night, way past my bedtime. I'm sitting on
the edge of my bed, screwdriver in hand, with the pieces of my partially
disassembled alarm clock neatly layed on my comforter. This isn't the first
time I've taken apart my alarm clock tonight. Seven year-old me loved to tear
apart Nerf guns, lightsabers, Rubik's cubes, and anything else of the sort
to try and figure out how it worked.

In fourth grade, I joined a First Lego League team at my school. Now instead of
taking apart my toys, I was able to design, build, and program contraptions of
my own to accomplish specific tasks. For the remainder of elementary and middle
school, I competed on my schools FLL team at the highest level: working 20 and
30 hour weeks, dominating at state competitions, and competing at worlds.

In high school, stemming from my love of understanding how things work and my
robotics experience, I specialized in programming. Programming perfectly fit
the mold my earlier experiences created. In computer science, there is an
immense amount of theory to learn and understanding to be gained. Now, instead
of taking apart my clock, I was delving through the layers of how computers and
software worked. My expanding knowledge and experience allowed me to tackle more
difficult problems. Now I'm writing embedded systems code for my Science
Olympiad team and the First Robotics Competition team I founded, helping peers
and teachers with coding problems, and developing personal projects in a dozen
languages.

A combination of my love of understanding things and my passion for engineering
fostered by committed experience ultimately led me to study Computer Science.

**Many students pursue college for a specific degree, career opportunity or
personal goal. Whichever it may be, learning will be critical to achieve your
ultimate goal. As you think ahead to the process of learning during your
college years, how will you define a successful college experience? (300)**

Successful college experience:
- Establish a group of friends consisting of both like-minded and different individuals
- Narrow my studies on the thing that interests me most: computer science & distributed systems
- Gain the skills, knowledge, and experience in order to enter the workforce

My primary goal in college is to gain the skills, knowledge, and experience
necessary to enter the workforce in the field of Computer Science. I have
chosen college over its alternatives because college allows me to narrow my
studies on the specific aspects of the larger field that interest me most. I
would define a successful college experience as one that prepares me to enter
the workforce, assists me in finding what engages me most, and provides me the
opportunity to discover as much as possible about that.

**Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to
emphasize about your application for the admission committee’s consideration?
Highlight something that’s important to you or something you haven’t had a
chance to share. Tell us, don’t show us (no websites please). (300)**
