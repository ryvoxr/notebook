# Colorado School of Mines

**Reflect on a time when you had to collaborate with individuals from diverse
backgrounds, experiences, or viewpoints. How did this experience impact your
understanding of identity and the importance of inclusivity? (250)**

*maybe make-able*

At the end of my Junior year I was recruited by my school's elite Science
Olympiad team for my technical expertise. I was asked to lead teams in three
events: optics, robot tour, and wind power. Each event had three teams of
varying skill levels. It was my job to lead all the teams as well as
participate on each event's Varsity team.

Throughout the beginning of the season, I worked closely with over thirty
students. Each student, regardless of their experience level, brought their own
ideas, skills, and commitment.

Importance of inclusivity: Giving people a chance to improve turns them into
future experienced people and leaders

**Please share a bit more about your academic interests. What do you hope to
study at Mines? If you are undecided, what area(s) of study are you
considering? What has inspired your interests in these areas? Think about your
prior/current coursework, extracurricular activities, work/volunteer
experiences, future goals, or anything else that has shaped your interests. (250)**

My chief interest, and recipient of the largest portion of my time, is
programming and computer science. My life inside and outside the classroom, in
structured activities and in free time, revolves around programming and
computers. I write my school assignments in LaTeX, and have programmatically
streamlined the homework process. In extracurriculars that require programming,
I stand out as the most experienced and skilled member; in extracurriculars not
directly related to computer science, I bring a unique skill set and way of
thinking to the table. In one of my largest extracurricular endeavors, I
co-founded a First Robotics Competition team and ran it with my friends out of
my garage.

The majority of my unstructured time is spent developing personal projects,
messing around with Linux, and assisting peers and teachers. I'm even helping a
current college Sophomore with her CS homework and enjoying the coursework. At
Mines I believe that my love of programming complemented with a strong
courseload will develop my passion, knowledge, and skill in the field.

Although I'm a programmer at heart, I've developed a deep interest in other
fields of engineering: mechanical and electrical through robotics, optical
through Science Olympiad, and many fields of physics through classwork and
clubs. Mines' broad engineering curriculum will empower me to explore
additional engineering topics alongside my chief interest in Computer Science.
