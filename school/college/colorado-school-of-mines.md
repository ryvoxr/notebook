**Reflect on a time when you had to collaborate with individuals from diverse
backgrounds, experiences, or viewpoints. How did this experience impact your
understanding of identity and the importance of inclusivity? (250)**

One year in the robotics club I was leading, a subset of my friends and I
decided to compete in the make:able challenge. The goal of the challenge was to
develop a product that improves the life of a disabled person. Two of my
friends loved to play chess with their father, who was blind. They noted that
the available blind-accessible chess sets were of poor quality and design. Our
team decided to fix this problem by designing and 3D printing a better blind
accessible-chess set.

Throughout the engineering process, we collaborated with my friend's father and
other members of the blind community. After numerous prototypes, we settled on
an inexpensive and simple design: inset squares to prevent tipping and custom,
tactile pieces for easy recognition.

Working closely with members of the blind community made me acutely aware of
the challenges they face daily. Understanding their background and experiences
strengthened my empathy and made clear the importance of developing accessible
product variants. I realized that inclusivity means ensuring that every person,
regardless of their abilities, has equal access to opportunities.

The genuine happiness that our chess set brought to my friend's family deepened
my belief in the power of inclusivity through innovation. This experience
proved that by embracing diverse perspectives when innovating, we can both
address specific needs and create moments of joy and empowerment.

**Please share a bit more about your academic interests. What do you hope to
study at Mines? If you are undecided, what area(s) of study are you
considering? What has inspired your interests in these areas? Think about your
prior/current coursework, extracurricular activities, work/volunteer
experiences, future goals, or anything else that has shaped your interests. (250)**

My chief interest, and the recipient of the largest portion of my time, is
computer science. My life inside and outside the classroom, in structured
activities and in free time, revolves around programming and computers. I write
my school assignments in LaTeX, and use Vim to programmatically streamline the
homework process. In extracurriculars that require programming, I stand out as
the most experienced and skilled member; in extracurriculars not directly
related to computer science, I bring a unique skill set and way of thinking to
the table. In one of my largest extracurricular endeavors, I co-founded a First
Robotics Competition team and ran it with my friends out of my garage.

The majority of my unstructured time is spent developing personal projects,
messing around with Linux, and assisting peers and teachers. I'm even helping a
current college sophomore with her CS homework and enjoying the coursework. At
Mines, I believe that my love of programming, complemented by a strong
courseload, will develop my passion, knowledge, and skills to prepare me for a
career as a programmer.

Although I'm a programmer at heart, I developed a deep interest in other fields
of engineering: mechanical and electrical through robotics, optical through
Science Olympiad, and many fields of physics through classwork and clubs.
Mines' broad engineering curriculum will empower me to explore additional
engineering topics alongside my chief interest in computer science.
