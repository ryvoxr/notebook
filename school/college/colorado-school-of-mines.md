At school I'm the kid with the thick laptop; the one who makes the fancy lab
reports; the one who refuses to use Google Docs; the one they call a hacker.
Guilty as charged! I'm a Lenovo X220 using, LaTeX writing, Google Docs
avoiding, Linux enjoying programmer. Some programmers will tell you with their
words that they're a coder, fewer will tell you with their actions.

For the last decade I have dedicated nearly all of my free time towards
programming, computers, and robotics. I was the sole programmer for the FRC
team that my friends and I founded and ran out of my garage my Junior year. My
school's prestigious Science Olympiad team recruited me to lead several of
their building events. At school, teachers enlisted me to write programs to
generate schedules for school-wide events. While I've significantly honed my
skills, I have yet to partake in a formal and rigorous computer science
curriculum. Colorado School of Mines' Computer Science department offers the
depth and breadth of programming instruction I yearn for.

While I've learned an immense amount through my own experience of building
things, I understand that there is a significant amount of underlying theory,
history, and knowledge that I've yet to be fully exposed to. At Mines I hope to
foster my understanding of the foundations of Computer Science as well as dive
deep into what interests me most.
