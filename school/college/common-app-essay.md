# Common App Essay (600)

**Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose
all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when
you want to learn more?**

One topic continues to captivate me: a system so complex that it's often
associated with magic, yet so beautifully simple and modular that an
experienced user can construct one to meet their exact needs. I am
captivated by computers, more specifically computer programming and
software. The innumerable layers from low-level device drivers and the
shell, to a graphical interface and user-facing applications, come
together to create the most widely used tool of the 21st century. 

Some computers are basic Windows installations, others are Macs, most are
graphic-less virtualized computers on servers. I created mine to be a finely
tuned, brutally efficient, GNU/Linux based machine that can run on nearly any
hardware. The design philosophy behind my software setup is efficiency and
speed. To that end, I use a modern variant of the legendary Vim, neovim, for
all my text editing. This includes working on school assignments, editing
system configuration files, and most importantly, programming.

I'm neither a talented artist nor an experienced musician, and I'm
certainly not a good singer. But when I'm in the zone, in front of my
monitor, coding, my hands never leaving the keyboard, I feel like a
wizard, coconut oily smooth, gliding from file to file, refactoring on
the fly. When I slip into the zone I can program for hours straight
without food, sleep, or human contact. At 6:00 PM, I could start working
on a simulation and pathfinding program for my school's Science Olympiad
robotics event. The next thing I know, the simulation is running
smoothly, the paths are generating properly, and it's 2:00 AM.

This phenomenon has come in handy. At the end of my Junior year, my
friends and I were operating a First Robotics Competition team out of my
garage. The FRC season spans multiple months and teams are typically
large and heavily organized operations. As a small group of just seven
students with no adult leadership, we were behind schedule. We found
ourselves on Thursday afternoon two days before the first competition
without any code and missing an entire subsystem. That night, and the
entirety of the next day, while the rest of the crew was working on
getting the end effector attached to the robot's arm, I wrote and tested
all the code for our robot, finishing with time to spare.

Something I find beautiful about programming is the openness of the
whole discipline. If I find a method, trait, or feature of a language or
library I don't understand, I can simply read the documentation or look
at the implementation to decipher for myself its purpose and use. More
often than not, instead of deliberately searching for more things to
learn, I find myself stumbling across new concepts and information when
problem solving and working on projects.

When taken at face value, the computer seemed like an impossible feat of
engineering. But, as I peeled back the layers over the years, the elegance,
simplicity, and power became clear. Programming is how I connect with the
computer in a deeper way. Programming allows me to interface with the very
system that catapulted human progress forward. Most importantly, programming
allows me to create.
