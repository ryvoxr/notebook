# Common App Essay (600)

**Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose
all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when
you want to learn more?**

One idea has captured my mind for the better part of my life: a system so
complex that it's often associated with magic, yet so beautifully simple and
modular that an experienced user can construct one to meet their exact needs
and wield one with great power and speed. That idea is a computer. More
specifically, I am captivated by computer programming and software. The
innumerable layers from low-level device drivers and the shell, to a graphical
interface and user-facing applications, coming together to create the most
widely used tool of the 21st century. 

Not all computers are created equally; some are common Windows installations,
others are Macs, most are graphic-less virtualised computers on servers. I've
created mine to be a finely tuned, brutally efficient, GNU/Linux based machine
that can run on nearly any hardware. The design philosophy behind my software
setup is efficiency and speed. To that end, I use neovim (a modern variant of
the legendary Vim) for all my text editing: working on school assignments,
editing system configuration files, and most importantly, programming.

I'm neither a talented artist nor an experienced musician, and I'm certainly
not a good singer. But when I'm in the zone, behind my computer monitor,
coding, my hands never leaving the keyboard, I feel like a wizard, coconut oily
smooth, gliding from file to file, refactoring on the fly. When I slip into the
zone like that I can program for hours straight without food, sleep, or human
contact. At 6:00 PM I could start working on a simulation and pathfinding
program for my school's Science Olympiad robotics event. The next thing I know
the simulation is running smoothly, the paths are generating properly, and it's
2:00 AM.

This phenomenon has come in handy. At the end of my Junior year, my friends and
I were operating a First Robotics Competition team out of my garage. The FRC
season spans multiple months and is typically a large and heavily organized
operation. As a small group of just seven students with no adult leadership, we
were behind schedule. We found ourselves on Thursday afternoon two days before
the first competition without any code and missing an entire subsystem. That
night, and the entirety of the next day, while the rest of the crew was working
on getting the end effector attached to the robot's arm, I wrote and tested all
the code for our robot, finishing with time to spare.

Something I find beautiful about programming is the openness of the whole
discipline. If I find a method, trait, or feature of a language or library I
don't understand, I can almost always simply read the documentation or look at
the implementation to decipher for myself its purpose and use. More often than
not, instead of deliberately searching for more things to learn, I find myself
stumbling across new concepts and information when problem solving and working
on projects.
