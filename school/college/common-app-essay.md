One idea has captured my mind for the better part of my life: the idea of a
system so complex that it's often associated with magic, yet so beautifully
simple and modular that an experienced user can construct one to meet his exact
desires and wield one with great power and speed. This idea is, of course, a
computer. More specifically, I am fascinated by computer programming and software. The
innumerable layers from low-level device drivers and the kernel, all the way up
to a graphical interface, comes together to create the most widely used tool of
the 21st century. 

Not all computers are created equally; some are basic Windows installations,
others are Macs, most are graphic-less virtualised computers on servers. Mine
is a finely tuned, half-custom, GNU/Linux based machine that can run on nearly
any hardware. The design philosophy behind my machine is efficiency and speed.
To that end, I use neovim (a modern variant of the legendary Vim) for all my
text editing: working on school assignments, editing system configuration
files, and most importantly, programming.

I'm neither a talented artist nor an experienced musician, and I'm certainly
not a good singer, but when I'm in the zone, behind my computer monitor,
coding, my hands never leaving the keyboard, I feel like a wizard, coconut oily
smooth, gliding from file to file, refactoring on the fly. When I slip into the
zone like that I can program for hours straight without food, sleep, or human
contact. At 6pm I start working on my speedcubing timer, trying to get scrambles to
generate properly, next thing I know scrambles are generating properly
and it's 1am.

To me, the ability that programming gives you to create literally anything from
nearly nothing is beautiful. 

Throughout my extended tenure as a programmer I have worked on numerous
projects. I was the sole programmer for the FRC team that my friends and I
founded and ran out of my garage my Junior year. My long-time hobby of
speedcubing intersected with my chief occupation of programming when I created
a terminal interface in Rust for timing and tracking my Rubik's Cube solves.
