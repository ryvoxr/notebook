One idea has captured my mind for the better part of my life: the idea of a
system so complex that it's often associated with magic, yet so beautifully
simple and modular that an experienced user can construct one to meet his exact
desires and wield one with great power and speed. This idea is, of course, a
computer.

More specifically, I am fascinated by computer programming and software. The
innumerable layers from low-level device drivers and the kernel all the way up
to a graphical interface comes together to create the most widely used tool of
the 21st century. 

Not all computers are created equally; some are basic Windows installations,
others are Macs, most are graphic-less virtualised computers on servers. Mine
is a finely tuned, half-custom, GNU/Linux based machine that can run on nearly
any hardware. The design philosophy behind my machine, nicknamed Anton, is
efficiency and speed. To that end, I use neovim (a modern variant of the
legendary Vim) for all my text editing: school assignments, system
configuration files, and most importantly, programming.

The freedom and limitless possibilities of programming have kept me discovering
and writing code for nearly a decade. While beating your head against the wall
trying to resolve an elusive segfault is certainly not romantic, the rush after
finally solving a problem has kept me going through projects big and small.

Throughout my extended tenure as a programmer I have worked on numerous
projects. I was the sole programmer for the FRC team that my friends and I
founded and ran out of my garage my Junior year. My long-time hobby of
speedcubing intersected with my chief occupation of programming when I created
a terminal interface in Rust for timing and tracking my Rubik's Cube solves.
