# NC State

**Explain why you selected the academic program(s) above and why you are
interested in studying these at NC State. (250)**

For the last decade I have dedicated most of my free time towards programming,
computers, and robotics. While I've significantly honed my skills, I have yet
to been able to take a rigorous computer science course. NC State's College of
Engineering's Computer Science major offers the depth and breadth of
programming instruction and learning I yearn for.


Robotics:
- FLL middle school
- Founded FRC high school
- Science Olympiad

Programming:
- Languages: Rust, C, Lua, Java, Python
- Projects: tiling window manager, cube-tui
- APCSP exam


**Discuss any other obstacles and/or hardships that you have encountered that
have affected you personally or academically and how you dealt with them.

**Critical and creative thinking are valuable skills in problem-solving. Tell
us about a time in which you used one or both of these skills to address a
problem or a need, in or out of the classroom. (600)**
