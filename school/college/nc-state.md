# NC State

**Explain why you selected the academic program(s) above and why you are
interested in studying these at NC State. (250)**

I've lived my entire life in Raleigh and go to high school just five minutes
from NC State. I had my mind set on going to State since I was in elementary
school. As I got older and my interests matured, I knew I wanted to be a part
of the wolfpack. 

My chief interest, and recipient of the largest portion of my time, is
programming and computer science. My life inside and outside the classroom, in
structured activities and in free time, revolves around programming and
computers. I write my school assignments in LaTeX, and have programmatically
streamlined the homework process. In extracurriculars that require programming,
I stand out as the most experienced and skilled member; in extracurriculars not
directly related to computer science, I bring a unique skill set and way of
thinking to the table. The majority of my unstructured time is spent developing
personal projects, messing around with Linux, and assisting peers and teachers.
I'm even helping a current NCSU Sophomore with her CS homework and enjoying the
coursework. At State I believe that my love of programming complemented with a
strong courseload will develop my passion, knowledge, and skill in the field.

Although I'm a programmer at heart, I've developed a deep interest in other
fields of engineering: mechanical and electrical through robotics, optical
through Science Olympiad, and many fields of physics through classwork and
clubs. State's broad engineering curriculum will empower me to explore
additional engineering topics alongside my chief interest in Computer Science.

**Discuss any other obstacles and/or hardships that you have encountered that
have affected you personally or academically and how you dealt with them.

I struggled both academically and personally during my freshman year. I was a
strong student up to that point: I did my homework, did well on quizzes and
tests, and consistently placed at the top for standardized assessments. I
struggled in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on my freshman year. During
that year, for the first time ever in my life, I wasn't engaged in class, I
failed to complete homework, and my grades plummeted.

I started high school without any of my friends from middle school. The
adjustment would have been difficult enough if school was in person, but being
virtual and unable to make friends for an entire year was devastating. I coped
by playing video games with friends from middle school, digging a deeper hole
for myself. I ended freshman year with the worst grades of my life.

Entering Sophomore year in person was a breath of fresh air. I bounced back
from my first year: I made new friends, did my homework, and started performing
well on quizzes and tests again. My GPA excluding freshman year is above a 3.9,
a whole point better than my freshman GPA. From this experience I learned that
I am most successful when engaged in person and able to collaborate. I hope
that NC State can look past my freshman grades and see me for the student I am
now and will continue to be.

**Critical and creative thinking are valuable skills in problem-solving. Tell
us about a time in which you used one or both of these skills to address a
problem or a need, in or out of the classroom. (600) (Honors College)**
