# NC State

**Explain why you selected the academic program(s) above and why you are
interested in studying these at NC State. (250)**

I've lived my entire life in Raleigh and go to high school just five minutes
from NC State. I had my mind set on going to State since I was in elementary
school. As I got older and my interests matured, I knew I wanted to be a part
of the Wolfpack. 

My chief interest, and recipient of the largest portion of my time, is
programming and computer science. My life inside and outside the classroom, in
structured activities and in free time, revolves around programming and
computers. I write my school assignments in LaTeX, and have programmatically
streamlined the homework process. In extracurriculars that require programming,
I stand out as the most experienced and skilled member; in extracurriculars not
directly related to computer science, I bring a unique skill set and way of
thinking to the table. The majority of my unstructured time is spent developing
personal projects, messing around with Linux, and assisting peers and teachers.
I'm even helping a current NCSU Sophomore with her CS homework and enjoying the
coursework. At State I believe that my love of programming complemented with a
strong courseload will develop my passion, knowledge, and skill in the field.

Although I'm a programmer at heart, I've developed a deep interest in other
fields of engineering: mechanical and electrical through robotics, optical
through Science Olympiad, and many fields of physics through classwork and
clubs. State's broad engineering curriculum will empower me to explore
additional engineering topics alongside my chief interest in Computer Science.

**Discuss any other obstacles and/or hardships that you have encountered that
have affected you personally or academically and how you dealt with them.

I struggled both academically and personally during my freshman year. I was a
strong student up to that point: I did my homework, did well on quizzes and
tests, and consistently placed at the top for standardized assessments. I
struggled in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on my freshman year. During
that year, for the first time ever in my life, I wasn't engaged in class, I
failed to complete homework, and my grades plummeted.

I started high school without any of my friends from middle school. The
adjustment would have been difficult enough if school was in person, but being
virtual and unable to make friends for an entire year was devastating. I coped
by playing video games with friends from middle school, digging a deeper hole
for myself. I ended freshman year with the worst grades of my life.

Entering Sophomore year in person was a breath of fresh air. I bounced back
from my first year: I made new friends, did my homework, and started performing
well on quizzes and tests again. My GPA excluding freshman year is above a 3.9,
a whole point better than my freshman GPA. From this experience I learned that
I am most successful when engaged in person and able to collaborate. I hope
that NC State can look past my freshman grades and see me for the student I am
now and will continue to be.

us about a time in which you used one or both of these skills to address a
problem or a need, in or out of the classroom. (600) (Honors College)**

The Power of One project is the final for the AP Environmental Science class at
my high school. The goal is to embark on a self-directed project in order to
make a positive difference in the environment. I identified that the lawn mower
I used to cut grass every week ran on gasoline, a dirty fuel. In class, we
learned about alternative fuels and the food waste disaster. Combining these
ideas, I decided to attempt to power my lawn mower using ethanol created from
food waste.

I set a reasonable goal for myself to create 1 gallon of ethanol. Assuming a
50% yield, I would need 40lbs of rotten fruits and vegetables. From my research
on food waste, I knew that supermarkets and other food retailers generate an
estimated 10 million tons of food waste per year. My local supermarkets were
more than happy to provide me with a generous quantity of rotten fruits of all
kinds.

The first step in turning my biomass into ethanol was to bring it into a
fermentable, liquid, state. Not having access to a mill, I purchased a
second-hand 40 gallon steel drum. After school one day, I recruited a dozen of
my friends to assist me in pulverizing the raw materials. For two hours at the
park next to our school, we mashed the rotten fruit in the barrel with PVC
pipe, tool handles, and big sticks.

I fermented the mash by sealing it in the barrel with yeast for a week. When
not in the presence of oxygen, yeast converts sugars to ethanol and carbon
dioxide. The large barrel offered adequate room for expansion so the added
pressure from the carbon dioxide didn't make it explode.

While the mixture was fermenting, I began work on designing and building a
still. A still separates a substance from the mixture through distillation. By
heating the mixture to 174 degrees, the ethanol will evaporate leaving the
water and other bits behind. I needed a way to capture the ethanol vapor and
cool it back into a liquid. My approach was to force the gas into a copper pipe
via a hole in the top of the heating pot and coil that pipe through an ice
filled bucket. I cut a hole at the bottom of the bucket for the pipe to stick
out and deposit liquid ethanol. Building the still turned out to be the most
difficult part of the entire project. I ran into countless issues: the sealant
melted and cracked, vapor escaped from the fittings and lid, the coil kinked
and snapped, and many other problems. Finally, after numerous redesigns and
tests with water, the still worked.

Using my homemade still, I distilled ethanol from the fermented mash. This
proved to be an incredibly time consuming and laborious process. I was using a
one gallon pot and had nearly ten gallons of material to go through. Throughout
the entire process, I had to keep the temperature perfect, too high and I would
pollute my distillate with water, too low and nothing would evaporate. For the
first couple pots, I pushed down on the lid with my hands to prevent steam
from escaping my makeshift lid; for the remaining loads, I sat two heavy rocks
on the lid. After nearly a full day of work, I was rewarded with slightly less
than a gallon of 140 proof ethanol.

After learning about my classmates' projects and sharing my project details in
school, my peers voted my project first place. More importantly, I could now
power my lawn mower using ethanol created from food waste.
