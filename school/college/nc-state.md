# NC State

**Explain why you selected the academic program(s) above and why you are

At school I'm the kid with the thick laptop; the one who makes the fancy lab
reports; the one who refuses to use Google Docs; the one they call a hacker.
Guilty as charged! I'm a Lenovo X220 using, LaTeX writing, Google Docs
avoiding, Linux enjoying programmer. Some programmers will tell you with their
words that they're a coder; fewer will tell you with their actions.

For the last decade I have dedicated most of my free time towards programming,
computers, and robotics. I was the sole programmer for the FRC  team that my
friends and I founded and ran out of my garage my Junior year. My long-time
hobby of speedcubing intersected with my chief interest of programming when I
created a terminal interface in Rust for timing and tracking my Rubik's Cube
solves. I've also developed numerous other applications from tiling window
managers to websites using Rust and Web Assembly. While I've significantly
honed my skills, I have yet to partake in a formal and rigorous computer
science curriculum. NC State's College of Engineering's Computer Science major
offers the depth and breadth of programming instruction I yearn for.

While I've learned an immense amount through my own experience of building
things, I understand that there is a significant amount of underlying theory,
history, and knowledge that I've yet to be fully exposed to. At NC State I hope
to foster my understanding of the foundations of Computer Science as well as
dive deep into what interests me most.

**Discuss any other obstacles and/or hardships that you have encountered that
have affected you personally or academically and how you dealt with them.

I struggled both academically and personally throughout my freshman year. I've
been a strong student for my entire life: I do my homework, do well on quizzes
and tests, and consistently place at the top of standardized assessments. My
entire first year of high school revolved around COVID-19. During this year,
for the first time ever in my life, I wasn't engaged in class, I failed to
complete homework, and my grades plummeted.

I graduated from a middle school with a class of just 60 kids into a high
school with a class of 100, none of which I knew. The adjustment would have
been difficult enough if school was in person, but being virtual and not being
able to make friends for an entire year was devastating.

It wasn't until the beginning of my Sophomore year that I saw the inside of the building.

**Critical and creative thinking are valuable skills in problem-solving. Tell
us about a time in which you used one or both of these skills to address a
problem or a need, in or out of the classroom. (600) (Honors College)**
