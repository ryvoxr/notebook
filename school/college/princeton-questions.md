# Princeton Questions

How was the student-professor relationship at Princeton different from that of
a larger school such as Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Were there any experiences or courses at Princeton that were external to your
major that had a significant impact on you.

Having navigated through different stages of your career, what did you find
were the most valuable skills and qualities that a student should develop
during their undergraduate studies.

I had one final question for you. As a canidate, in which areas do I have room
for improvement and in where do you feel I am strong?
