# Princeton

**Please describe why you are interested in studying engineering at Princeton.
Include any of your experiences in, or exposure to engineering, and how you
think the programs offered at the University suit your particular interests. (250)**

My chief interest, and recipient of the largest portion of my time, is
programming and computer science. My life inside and outside the classroom, in
structured activities and in free time, revolves around programming and
computers. I write my school assignments in LaTeX, and have programmatically
streamlined the homework process. In extracurriculars that require programming,
I stand out as the most experienced and skilled member; in extracurriculars not
directly related to computer science, I bring a unique skill set and way of
thinking to the table. The majority of my unstructured time is spent developing
personal projects, messing around with Linux, and assisting peers and teachers.
I'm even helping a current college sophomore with her CS homework and enjoying
the coursework. At Princeton I believe that my love of programming complemented
with a strong courseload will develop my passion, knowledge, and skill in the
field.

I love programming from the ground up and hate coding with abstraction I don't
understand. I write in C and Rust, reinvent the wheel, and prefer good code
over clean code. In my opinion, systems programming is the pinnacle of computer
science. Princeton's computer science systems track aligns perfectly with my
interests.

Although I'm a programmer at heart, I've developed a deep interest in other
fields of engineering: mechanical and electrical through robotics, optical
through Science Olympiad, and many fields of physics through classwork and
clubs. Princeton's broad engineering curriculum will empower me to explore
additional engineering topics alongside my chief interest in Computer Science.

**Princeton values community and encourages students, faculty, staff and
leadership to engage in respectful conversations that can expand their
perspectives and challenge their ideas and beliefs. As a prospective member of
this community, reflect on how your lived experiences will impact the
conversations you will have in the classroom, the dining hall or other campus
spaces. What lessons have you learned in life thus far? What will your
classmates learn from you? In short, how has your lived experience shaped you?

Had a hard time freshman year, learned that I learn and work best when given a
chance to collaborate and socialize with others.

Importance of challenging beliefs and open discussion
- Economics class, even as kids we have strong beliefs
- By engaging in civil, uncensored discussion we can do good

Importance of teaching others and sharing expertise
- Science Olympiad, recruited to share expertise and train the next round of
  experts
- The thing that separates humans from other animals is our ability to
  communicate, record, and learn from our experiences over generations. Sharing
  and teaching is the only way to continue that process

Importance of hard work and taking pride in your work
- Doing good work

**Princeton has a longstanding commitment to understanding our responsibility
to society through service and civic engagement. How does your own story
intersect with these ideals? (250)**

Scouts has been a major part of my life since I was five years old. Most people
imagine Boy Scouts as a group of teenage boys going out into the woods and
learning survival skills. While we certainly do that, any scout will tell you
that the real point is leadership and service. The overarching philosophy of my
troop is servant leadership. Which dictates that, no matter how high one's
rank or position, he leads by example and through acts of service.

As Senior Patrol Leader of my troop, I embodied that philosophy. Throughout my
tenure, I learned that acts of service, both as a community and as individuals,
are conducive to societal well-being and personally self-fulfilling.

I've also applied this methodology to my life outside of scouts. In school and
extracurricular settings, I find it most productive to communicate through
action and lead by example. For instance, in my First Robotics Competition
team, I found it easiest to get people to clean up the shop by simply starting
to clean up myself. Humans are imitators and by providing a productive model to
imitate, the community will be better off.

At Princeton, I will apply this philosophy of servant leadership and share
it with my peers. I believe that this will ultimately create a more respectful,
productive, and thriving community.

**What is a new skill you would like to learn in college? (50)**

I would like to learn how to weld.

**What brings you joy? (50)**

Getting stuck on a hard problem and then figuring it out on my own.

**What song represents the soundtrack of your life at this moment? (50)**

Ramble On - Led Zeppelin
