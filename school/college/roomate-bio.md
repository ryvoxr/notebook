# Roommate Bio

Hey, I'm Henry and I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina. I'll be majoring in
Computer Science at Mines. In my free time I like programming in Rust, lifting,
and reading Tolkien. I'm super chill and a great study buddy. I'm always down
to go out or just have a chill night in. If anybody's looking for a great
roommate, someone to hang out with, or just a new friend at Mines, feel free to
reach out.
