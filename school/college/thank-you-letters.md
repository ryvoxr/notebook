# Thank You Letters

### Mr. Wajima

Mr Wajima,

I would like to express my utmost gratitude to you for investing in me and
writing my letter of recommendation.

When you talk about writing recs in class it brings a smile to my face. I love
the idea that your recommendation was more about me as a student and person
rather than based solely on my work.

So far I've been accepted to Colorado School of Mines and UNC Charlotte and
rejected from Princeton. I'm still waiting to hear from NC State, Virginia
Tech, Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, and WashU. I'll keep you in the loop about
my decisions.

Thank you again and happy holidays,

Henry Oehlrich

### Mr. Hames

Mr. Hames,

I would like to express my utmost thanks and appreciation to you for investing
in me and writing my letter of recommendation.

Through the building projects last year in Oceans and APES, Power of One, and
Science Olympiad, you've seen a side of me that no other teacher has. I love
that someone who knows me for my technical experience and problem solving was
able to speak for me on my college application.

So far I've been accepted to Colorado School of Mines (which you introduced me
to) and UNC Charlotte and rejected from Princeton. I'm still waiting to hear
from NC State, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, and WashU. I'll
keep you in the loop about my decisions.

Thank you again and happy holidays,

Henry Oehlrich
