For the last decade I have dedicated most of my free time towards programming,
computers, and robotics. I was the sole programmer for the FRC team that my
friends and I founded and ran out of my garage my Junior year. My long-time
hobby of speedcubing intersected with my chief interest of programming when I
created a terminal interface in Rust for timing and tracking my Rubik's Cube
solves. I've also developed numerous other applications from tiling window
managers to websites using Rust and Web Assembly. While I've significantly
honed my skills, I have yet to partake in a formal and rigorous computer
science curriculum. UNC Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics'
Computer Science major offers the depth and breadth of programming instruction
I yearn for.

Unlike many other colleges, UNC Charlotte's Computer Science degree is not
lumped in with their engineering program. Instead, the Computer Science program
is contained inside of the College of Computing and Informatics. This
separation of computing and engineering is exciting to me. At UNC Charlotte,
instead of spending class hours learning engineering concepts not totally
relevant to my major, I hope to be able deep dive into the CS topics that interest
me most.
