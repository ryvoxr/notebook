# Virginia Tech

[https://www.vt.edu/admissions/undergraduate/apply/freshman-checklist.html](https://www.vt.edu/admissions/undergraduate/apply/freshman-checklist.html.md)

**Virginia Tech’s motto is "Ut Prosim" which means 'That I May Serve'. Share how
you contribute to a community that is important to you. How long have you been
involved? What have you learned and how would you like to share that with
others at Virginia Tech? (120)**

Scouts has been a major part of my life since I was 5 years old. Most people
imagine Boy Scouts as a group of teenage boys going out into the woods and
learning survival skills. While we certainly do that, any scout will tell you
that the real point is leadership and service. The overarching philosophy of my
troop was servant leadership. Which dictates that, no matter how high one's
rank or position, he leads by example and through acts of service.

At Virginia Tech, I will apply this philosophy of servant leadership and share
it with my peers. I believe that this will ultimately create a more respectful,
empathetic, and thriving community.

**Virginia Tech’s Principles of Community supports access and inclusion by
affirming the dignity and value of every person, respecting differences,
promoting mutual understanding and open expression, and strives to eliminate
bias and discrimination. Reflect on a time when you were not able or allowed to
express a different or diverse position or opinion (or you witnessed another
person or group experience the same situation)? How did you respond or wish you
would have responded? Did your viewpoint change in any way after this
experience? (120)**

Maybe talk about economics

**Share a time when you were most proud of yourself either as a role model or
when you displayed your leadership. What specific skills did you contribute to
the experience? How did others rely on you for guidance? What did you learn
about yourself during this time? (120)**

At the end of my Junior year, I helped run a First Robotics Competition team
out of my garage. A FRC team is usually large and heavily organized, but my
team consisted of just six other friends. 

At the first competition, as the one who had the most technical experience, I
took the reigns and lead our team. I both delegated responsibility to others
and did things myself. When issues or questions came up, my teammates
collaborated with me to fix the problem. One time, when our robot's intake
broke, I ensured everyone's opinion was heard and considered; then we decided
on the best course of action.

Throughout this experience I learned that I work better under stress.

**Describe a goal that you have set and the steps you will take to achieve it.
What made you set this goal for yourself? What is your timeline to achieve this
goal? Who do you seek encouragement or guidance from as you work on this goal?
(120)**

I was recruited by my school's elite Science Olympiad team for my technical
expertise. I was asked to lead our multiple teams in three building events:
optics, robot tour, and wind power. I set a personal goal at the beginning of
the season: rank in the top five at States for each of the varsity teams I
lead.

So far, I have held event meetings to organize information and start the design
process. Before States, we will compete in several invitational tournaments to
track our improvement. For advice, encouragement, and feedback I will reach out
to our teacher sponsor. For event-specific tips, I have connected to teachers
with extensive knowledge in the subject.
