**Virginia Tech’s motto is "Ut Prosim" which means 'That I May Serve'. Share how
you contribute to a community that is important to you. How long have you been
involved? What have you learned and how would you like to share that with
others at Virginia Tech? (120)**

**Virginia Tech’s Principles of Community supports access and inclusion by
affirming the dignity and value of every person, respecting differences,
promoting mutual understanding and open expression, and strives to eliminate
bias and discrimination. Reflect on a time when you were not able or allowed to
express a different or diverse position or opinion (or you witnessed another
person or group experience the same situation)? How did you respond or wish you
would have responded? Did your viewpoint change in any way after this
experience? (120)**

**Share a time when you were most proud of yourself either as a role model or
when you displayed your leadership. What specific skills did you contribute to
the experience? How did others rely on you for guidance? What did you learn
about yourself during this time? (120)**

**Describe a goal that you have set and the steps you will take to achieve it.
What made you set this goal for yourself? What is your timeline to achieve this
goal? Who do you seek encouragement or guidance from as you work on this goal?
