# Zen of Wajima

When you're stuck,
Use a hammer.
You can only remember 7 +- 2,
So write it down.
Although you might be wrong,
Be confident in yourself,
Because you never know where it might take you.
Be comfortable being wrong.
There is never only one way to do it.
Hate is a strong word.
If you're sorry, you wouldn't have done it.
