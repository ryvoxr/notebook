=== What inspired you? ===
1. Really kind and inspiring 6th grade English teacher (Mrs. Reagen)

    - References to Tolkien's works in some of the music I was listening to
    - Very hooked
        - Was pretty much my entire life for a year
- Silmarillion
    - Attempt 1 ~ 14yo (first full year of covid)
        - Almost got through the history of the Noldor
    - Committed to actually finishing it ~ 15yo (last year)
        - Things really pick up once you get to Beren and Luthien
        - Actually finished it with minimal understanding
    - Reread several times (with friends this time)

=== What stops you or has in the past ===
1. Required reading for school
2. Being busy
3. Just not actually starting to read

=== Who are you as a reader ===
1. Enjoy a limited variety of genres
- High fantasy
- Science fiction
    - Really love Frank Herbert's Dune
    - Also some not-so-classics
- Some non-fiction
    - Programming books are pretty good
        - Distinction: not teaching you a language, but speaking generally
          about idioms, style, or culture
    - Science stuff
        - Physics books are fun (usually go right over my head though)
2. Generally have no trouble finishing a book once started. The decision to
   start one is difficult though
