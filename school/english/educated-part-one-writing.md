# Part One Writing

## Dad's control and authority over the family

For the majority of Part One of *Educated*, Dad's authority was ubiquitous and
uncontested. Shawn, trying to protect Tara from the shear, and being the only
one able to stand up to Dad, "had awoken something in Dad". If Tara didn't run
the shear, "Dad would no longer be Dad" (Westover, 2018, pp. 140). This event
represents a battle for the head of the household, which Dad won. Throughout
part one, we see how the only way to escape his control is to leave.
