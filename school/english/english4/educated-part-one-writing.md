# Part One Writing

## Dad's control and authority over the family

For the majority of Part One of *Educated*, Dad's authority was ubiquitous and
uncontested. Shawn, trying to protect Tara from the shear, and being the only
one able to stand up to Dad, "had awoken something in Dad". If Tara didn't run
the shear, "Dad would no longer be Dad" (Westover, 2018, pp. 140). This event
represents a battle for the head of the household, which Dad won. Throughout
part one, we see how the only way to escape his control is to leave. After
Tyler returned home, he told Tara: "as long as you live under Dad's roof, it's
hard to go when he asks you not to" (Westover, 2018, pp. 120). By extentsion,
once you make the decision to leave "Dad's roof", you are no longer under his
influence.

## Family's distrust in the education system, and Tara breaking away from that

The idea of the family's distrust in the education system is evident in Part
One of *Educated*. Tara's father describes college as "extra school for people
to dumb to learn the first time around" (Westover, 2018, pp. 42); he describes
college professors as either lying, or thinking they're telling the truth.
Dad's pontificating about the education system affected his children at a
young age, instilling the distrust in the system in them as well. Tara completes
her breaking off from her father's views when she gets the acception letter into
BYU. In response to this, her father says "You've already decided... No point
in dragging it out".
