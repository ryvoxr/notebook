# Outline

## Introduction to Rust

- Memory safety without a garbage collector
- High level ergonomics with low level control and speed
- Rich and algebraic type system
- Voted most loved programming language 7 years in a row
- Every platform from embedded devices to desktop apps to WASM
- C++ was for the last 40 years and Rust is for the next 40

## Borrow checker

- Memory safety without a garbage collector
- Bad things about gc (memory spikes, speeds, full stop, etc)
- Two rules of the borrow checker
- Fearless concurrency (no race conditions)
- No memory leaks
- Problems and famous memory leaks
- Rust will not let you write unsafe code

## Type system

- Traits, types, structs, and enums
- Algebraic type system (product and sum types)
- Zero cost abstractions
- No runtime types
- Semicolons have meaning
- Rich types make invalid states unrepresentable
- Generics without templates
- C-like syntax

## Speed

- Within 10% the speed of C
- Sometimes compiles to identical assembly
- Very tiny runtime
- Energy, hardware, and cost savings
- Environmentally friendly
