# General Notes

1. Crash points explicitly stated
2. Rust will not let you write unsafe code
3. Rust is a really pleasant language to write in
4. Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector
5. Familiar C-like syntax
6. Semicolons have meaning
7. No nulls
8. Rich types make invalid states unpresentable
9. Modern tooling
10. No memory leaks or SQL injection
11. Most loved language 7 years in an row
12. Rust errors happen at compile time
13. Fearless concurrency
14. Zero cost abstractions
15. Algebraic type system
16. No runtime types

Problems today:
- Security breaches
- Ransomware attacks
- Operational failures
- Safety critical failures

The borrow checker:
- Data has one owner
- Data may have multiple readers or one writer
