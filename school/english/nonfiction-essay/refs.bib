      In this book, the author goes beyond the basics by exploring
          exploring common advanced programming patterns and
          concepts. Instead of defining a trait, he shows
          meaningful, stateful, applications of traits in
          specific problems

        This is the official Rust Language website. It is created and maintained
            by the Rust Team (Rust maintainers) as well as many contributions
            form the community. It mostly serves as a launching point for
            learning and participating in Rust. As well has maintaining links,
            this site has a blog for Rust news for update and feature

        Rust by example is a website that shows you many of the features of
            rust through thorough code examples and descriptions. It is a great
            way to get concise, correct code, in order to better explain
            complex ideas.
