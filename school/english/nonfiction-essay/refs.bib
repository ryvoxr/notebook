  publisher = {No Starch},
  annotation = {
      In this book, the author goes beyond the basics by exploring
          exploring common advanced programming patterns and
          concepts. Instead of defining a trait, he shows
          meaningful, stateful, applications of traits in
          specific problems

        This is the official Rust Language website. It is created and maintained
            by the Rust Team (Rust maintainers) as well as many contributions
            form the community. It mostly serves as a launching point for
            learning and participating in Rust. As well has maintaining links,
            this site has a blog for Rust news for update and feature
            announcements.

        Rust by example is a website that shows you many of the features of
            rust through thorough code examples and descriptions. It is a great
            way to get concise, correct code, in order to better explain
            complex ideas.

@book{the-c-programming-language,
  author = {Bryan Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie},
  year = {1972},
  title = {The C Programming Language},
  publisher = {Prentice Hall},
  annotation = {
      In this book, the authors, having created the C programming
          language, give a deep dive into it. This book teachs
          the reader C, but more importantly, it teaches how
          computer registers, memory, and data work and are
          stored at the most basic level. Although it follows a
          different paradigm from Rust, it is impossible to
          cohesively cover a programming language without paying
          homage to C.

        This Youtube channel is an excellent secondary/tertiary source for
            concise, complete analysis of the Rust language. While other
            sources merely gives the facts, this channel shows real-world
            applications as well as fun independent use cases.

        The Stack Overflow developwer survey is a yearly survey of developers
            to gather and analyze trends. It is a survey of users of Stack
            Overflow, that is to say programmers. It could be slightly biased
            because the most experieced and best programmers do not use stack
            overflow.
