## The nature of the new industrial economy that took shape after the War of 1812

Charles Pinkney
- We should have more slavery
- More slaves -> more produce -> more revenue

Samuel Slater
- First factory in Rhode Island
    - Birthplace of the industrial revolution in the US
- Stole the tech from England

Brown industrialized cotton milling using river power
- Slater's machine made that happen

Cotton gin
- Mechanized the process of removing seeds from cotton
- Much more efficient
- Perpetuated slavery

Entrepreneurs bright money from the US and England Transformation from woods
and subsidence production into a massive commercial agricultural complex
- Requires both land and labor

2 million slaves are working in 8 cotton states
- The US has conquered and claimed much more land
- Producing 88 to 95% of the cotton that is sold in Liverpool (biggest cotton
  market)

## The roles of both the North and South in this economy

South Carolina and George
- Powerful push to expand southwest
    - Alabama, Mississippi, Texas
- Pushes the natives out
- Manifest destiny
    - God's will that white people spread across the continent

## How westward expansion and dispossession of Native people figured into the process

Made deals with European empires that had claim to the land
- Also had to make deals with the Natives living on the land
- Pushes out all of them via violence or forced treaties

Tribes would sign a treaty
- We'll give up land here, if we get land there
- Then white settlers move into the Native land despite the boundary that is
  there
- National government intervenes in conflicts and fights the natives

Adams lost the election to Jackson

People sold and being transported to the new cotton states
- Moved together by the hundreds
- One long chain of people
- Journeys take weeks
- Moved a million people in this way

## The role of violence in maintaining the Cotton Empire

Violence is a part of the system that is America
- Have to use violence on a daily basis in order to scare people into working

Cotton picking was the bottleneck
- Slowest most difficult part of the production process
- Productivity increased dramatically

Most of the increase was brought apart by the people doing the picking
