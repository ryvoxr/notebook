### 1929

Hoover became president

Stock market was climbing to unprecedented levels
- Some investors were taking advantage of low interest rates by buying stocks
  on credit (this pushed prices even higher)
- The bubble burst and dropped by almost 50%

After the stock market crash President Hoover tried to prevent panic from
spreading throughout the economy
- Told business leaders to maintain wages
- Hoover believed that financial losses should affect profits not employment
- Hoover received $1.8 billion from private industries to stimulate employment
  in the 30's

### 1930

People praised the President's intervention
- "No one in his place could have done more. Very few of his predecessors have
  done as much"
- Government and business had spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the
  entirety of the previous year
- Consumers cut back their spending which caused businesses and manufacturers
  to lay of employees

President Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE)
- Created by Hoover in October of 1930
- Coordinated state and local relief programs and developed methods for
  increasing employment in the private sector
- The PECE had limited success

Hoover requested that the Federal Reserve increase credit
- Persuaded Congress to transfer agricultural surpluses from the Federal Farm
  Board to the Red Cross for distribution to relief agencies

### 1931

Economic conditions improved in early 1931

A series of bank collapses in Europe affected the American economy
- The PECE was organized as the President's Organization for Unemployment
  Relief (POUR)
- Worked on implementing a national fund drive for unemployment relief
- Hoovers attempt to promote local relief programs rather than asking Congress
  to create nationwide relief programs were viewed as callous disregard for the
  unemployed
