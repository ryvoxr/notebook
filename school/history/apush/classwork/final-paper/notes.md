Topic: Causes of the Great Depression

Question: What are the major causes of the Great Depression and to what extent
is each impactful

## Basic Economics

From 1929 to 1933, the total quantity of money in the US declined by 1/3.
- The total number of banks went down by one third
- It declined because the Federal Reserve system failed to prevent the decline
- The Federal Reserve system could have prevented the decline at all times

"The Great Depression was not produced by a failure of business. On the
contrary it was produced by a failure of government and a failure of government
in an area in which responsibility had been assigned to government since the
founding of the country."

Sequence of events:
1. October 1929 Stock Market Crash
2. 2 months later unemployment peaked at 9%
3. Over the next several months unemployment began to subside irregularly
4. June 1930 -> unemployment was 6.3%
5. Government intervenes with the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs
6. A thousand economists signed a public appeal not to pass the
7. Double digit unemployment for the first time
8. Never fell below double digits for the entire remainder of the 30s
9. FDR comes in 1933
10. National Recovery Act and Agricultural Adjustment Act and Wagner Act
12. World War Two
13. World War Two brought 12 million men out of the employment force
14. Dr. New Deal was replaced by Dr. End the war

## What Caused the Great Depression
https://fee.org/articles/what-caused-the-great-depression/

Great Depression:
- From 1929 to 1933, production of the nation's factories, mines, and utilities
  fell by more than 50%
- People's disposable incomes dropped by 28%
- Number of unemployed Americans 10xed from 1929 to 1933
- One out of every four workers was out of a job

Four phases of the Great Depression:
1. The governments "easy money" policies caused an artificial economic boom and
   a subsequent crash
2. Hoover's interventionist policies after the crash suppressed the
   self-adjusting aspect of the market preventing recovery and prolonging the
   depression
3. Roosevelt's New Deal expanded interventionism everywhere
4. Labor laws such as the Wagner Act destroyed the remaining healthy sectors of
   the economy

### Easy Money

The government in the 1920s created monetary policy that ballooned the quantity
of money and credit in the economy.
- Great boom occurred followed by the Great Depression

Investors rely on interest rates to gauge the level of risk of various
investments
- A relatively low interest rate for a loan signals that the loan is probably
  safe
- A high interest rate shows that the money could better be spent elsewhere
- The government's expansion of the money supply reduces and falsifies interest
  rates which misguides businessmen

The prices of goods continue to increase until business is no longer profitable
- Then the decline begins

To prolong to boom, monetary authorities (the fed) inject new money 
- When they stop the boom ends and a big depression begins

Government adds money to the market in the form of credit expansion
- Business firms mistakenly view this as an increase in the supply of capital

The boom in the 20s:
1. Economic decline in 1924
2. Government creates $500 million in credit
3. Seems beneficial and lifts out of 1924 decline
4. Fed made more money (inflation) in 1927

The bust:
- Easy-money effects of the expansion wore off and monetary authorities slowed
  the growth of the money supply
- Federal Reserve sold government securities and halted bank credit expansion
- By early 1929, the Fed stopped the flow of money, raised interest rates, and
  presided over a money supply that shrank %30 over the next 3 years
  
### Hoover's Anti-Adjustment Policies

Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
- Aimed to prop up prices in the American economy by keeping foreign products
  out
- Raised American tariffs to unprecedented levels. Practically closed our
  borders to foreign goods
- "One we raised our tariffs an irresistible movement all over the world
  to raise tariffs and to erect other trade barriers, including quotas,
  began. Protectionism ran wild over the world. Markets were cut off.
  Trade lines were narrowed. Unemployment in the export industries all
  over the world grew with great rapidity. Farm prices in the United
  State dropped sharply through the whole of 1930, but the most rapid
  rate of decline came following the passage of the tariff bill."

Revenue Act of 1932:
- Doubled the income tax
- Tax exemptions were lowered
- "Earned income credit" was eliminated
- Surtaxes were raised from 20% to 55%

## Revisiting the Great Depression

Smoot-Hawley Tariff:
- "became synonomous with an avalanche of protectionism that led to the
  collapse of world trade and the Great Depression"

### Friedman and Schwartz

Argued that the Federal Reserve caused the Depression by failing to rescue the
banking system
- From 1929 to 1933 more thwn two-fifths of the nations banks had failed
- Amount of money shrank by a third

This steep decline drove prices and production down
- The irony is that the Federal Government created the Fed in 1914 to prevent
  this exact thing

## On the Origins of the Great Depression
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1057202?searchText=Causes+of+the+great+depression&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DCauses%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bgreat%2Bdepression&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A5aa02e95acce1458fc4f1c44cc1b5873

Questions:
1. What were the underlying causes of the Great Depression of the nineteen-thirties?
2. Why did the downturn in 1929 become so severe?
3. Why was the depression so prolonged?
4. Where did it originate?
5. Why did it spread throughout the world?

### Create of Excess Capacity in the United States

Tendency of the American economy to generate capacity faster than demand
- Speculative optimism in the 1920s prolonged the boom and deepened the
  depression
- Had the model alone been at work, the depression would have occurred sooner
  and been milder

Every boom represents a distortion away from an equilibrium (balanced)
- This distortion is an unmaintainable rate of capital creation
- Private gross domestic investment averaged 16.3% of gross national product
  for seven years

Difference between this depression from others was the monetary breakdown
- Monetary guidance had failed not merely by a failure of policy, but by sheer
  impotence

## Textbook

### Huey Long

Democratic governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932
- Achieved stunning popularity

Increased taxes on corporations, lowered the utility bills of consumers, and
built new highways, hospitals, and school

Established a new movement
- Inequalities in the distribution of wealth prohibited millions of ordinary
  families from buying the goods that kept factories humming

### "Roosevelt Recession"

From 1933 to 1937, gross domestic product had grown at a yearly rate of about 10%
- Brought industrial output back to 1929 levels
- Unemployment went from 24 to 14 percent

Acting on the assumption that "the emergency has passed" Roosevelt slashed the
federal budget
- Congress cut the WPA's funding in half causing layoffs of about 1.5 million
  workers
- The Federal reserve, fearing inflation, raised interest rates
- Roosevelt once again began to spend his way out of the recession by boosting
  funding for the WPA and resuming public works projects

## Keyenes

Keys "transformed" economic thinking in capitalist societies in the 1920s
- Argued that government intervention could smooth out the highs and lows of
  the business cycle through deficit spending and the manipulation of interest
  rates

## Hoover Institute, Great Depression Exhibit
https://hoover.archives.gov/exhibits/great-depression

### 1929

Hoover became president

Stock market was climbing to unprecedented levels
- Some investors were taking advantage of low interest rates by buying stocks
  on credit (this pushed prices even higher)
- The bubble burst and dropped by almost 50%

After the stock market crash President Hoover tried to prevent panic from
spreading throughout the economy
- Told business leaders to maintain wages
- Hoover believed that financial losses should affect profits not employment
- Hoover received $1.8 billion from private industries to stimulate employment
  in the 30's

### 1930

People praised the President's intervention
- "No one in his place could have done more. Very few of his predecessors have
  done as much"
- Government and business had spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the
  entirety of the previous year
- Consumers cut back their spending which caused businesses and manufacturers
  to lay of employees

President Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE)
- Created by Hoover in October of 1930
- Coordinated state and local relief programs and developed methods for
  increasing employment in the private sector
- The PECE had limited success

Hoover requested that the Federal Reserve increase credit
- Persuaded Congress to transfer agricultural surpluses from the Federal Farm
  Board to the Red Cross for distribution to relief agencies

### 1931

Economic conditions improved in early 1931

A series of bank collapses in Europe affected the American economy
- The PECE was organized as the President's Organization for Unemployment
  Relief (POUR)
- Worked on implementing a national fund drive for unemployment relief
- Hoovers attempt to promote local relief programs rather than asking Congress
  to create nationwide relief programs were viewed as callous disregard for the
  unemployed
