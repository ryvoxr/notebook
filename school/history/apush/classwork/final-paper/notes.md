## The UNIX Operating System: A Model for Software Design

UNIX is a time-sharing operating system
- Program that controls the resources of a computer and allocates them among users
- Permits programs to run according to a scheduling policy

Time Sharing
- An environment where users access the system from terminals
- Scheduling rule which switches between users to give each a share of the processor in turn
- Makes it possible for people to interact with programs as they execute them
- OS like an onion

History:
1. Ken Thompson's experience with the PDP-7
2. Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics project
3. Got a PDP-11/20 and then a PDP-11/45
4. UNIX gradually spread throughout Bell Labs
5. UNIX is rewritten from assembly into C
6. UNIX is made available as a licensed software package
7. UNIX is ported to other machines via it's C base
8. 3000 UNIX systems worldwide

File System:
- OS stores and retrieves information for users
- Hierarchy of directories which contain info about their contents
