## What Caused the Great Depression
https://fee.org/articles/what-caused-the-great-depression/

Great Depression:
- From 1929 to 1933, production of the nation's factories, mines, and utilities
  fell by more than 50%
- People's disposable incomes dropped by 28%
- Number of unemployed Americans 10xed from 1929 to 1933
- One out of every four workers was out of a job

Four phases of the Great Depression:
1. The governments "easy money" policies caused an artificial economic boom and
   a subsequent crash
2. Hoover's interventionist policies after the crash suppressed the
   self-adjusting aspect of the market preventing recovery and prolonging the
   depression
3. Roosevelt's New Deal expanded interventionism everywhere
4. Labor laws such as the Wagner Act destroyed the remaining healthy sectors of
   the economy

### Easy Money

The government in the 1920s created monetary policy that ballooned the quantity
of money and credit in the economy.
- Great boom occurred followed by the Great Depression

Investors rely on interest rates to gauge the level of risk of various
investments
- A relatively low interest rate for a loan signals that the loan is probably
  safe
- A high interest rate shows that the money could better be spent elsewhere
- The government's expansion of the money supply reduces and falsifies interest
  rates which misguides businessmen

The prices of goods continue to increase until business is no longer profitable
- Then the decline begins

To prolong to boom, monetary authorities (the fed) inject new money 
- When they stop the boom ends and a big depression begins

Government adds money to the market in the form of credit expansion
- Business firms mistakenly view this as an increase in the supply of capital

The boom in the 20s:
1. Economic decline in 1924
2. Government creates $500 million in credit
3. Seems beneficial and lifts out of 1924 decline
4. Fed made more money (inflation) in 1927

The bust:
- Easy-money effects of the expansion wore off and monetary authorities slowed
  the growth of the money supply
- Federal Reserve sold government securities and halted bank credit expansion
- By early 1929, the Fed stopped the flow of money, raised interest rates, and
  presided over a money supply that shrank %30 over the next 3 years
  
### Hoover's Anti-Adjustment Policies

Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
- Aimed to prop up prices in the American economy by keeping foreign products
  out
- Raised American tariffs to unprecedented levels. Practically closed our
  borders to foreign goods
- "One we raised our tariffs an irresistible movement all over the world
  to raise tariffs and to erect other trade barriers, including quotas,
  began. Protectionism ran wild over the world. Markets were cut off.
  Trade lines were narrowed. Unemployment in the export industries all
  over the world grew with great rapidity. Farm prices in the United
  State dropped sharply through the whole of 1930, but the most rapid
  rate of decline came following the passage of the tariff bill."

Revenue Act of 1932:
- Doubled the income tax
- Tax exemptions were lowered
- "Earned income credit" was eliminated
- Surtaxes were raised from 20% to 55%

### 1929

Hoover became president

Stock market was climbing to unprecedented levels
- Some investors were taking advantage of low interest rates by buying stocks
  on credit (this pushed prices even higher)
- The bubble burst and dropped by almost 50%

After the stock market crash President Hoover tried to prevent panic from
spreading throughout the economy
- Told business leaders to maintain wages
- Hoover believed that financial losses should affect profits not employment
- Hoover received $1.8 billion from private industries to stimulate employment
  in the 30's

### 1930

People praised the President's intervention
- "No one in his place could have done more. Very few of his predecessors have
  done as much"
- Government and business had spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the
  entirety of the previous year
- Consumers cut back their spending which caused businesses and manufacturers
  to lay of employees

President Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE)
- Created by Hoover in October of 1930
- Coordinated state and local relief programs and developed methods for
  increasing employment in the private sector
- The PECE had limited success

Hoover requested that the Federal Reserve increase credit
- Persuaded Congress to transfer agricultural surpluses from the Federal Farm
  Board to the Red Cross for distribution to relief agencies

### 1931

Economic conditions improved in early 1931

A series of bank collapses in Europe affected the American economy
- The PECE was organized as the President's Organization for Unemployment
  Relief (POUR)
- Worked on implementing a national fund drive for unemployment relief
- Hoovers attempt to promote local relief programs rather than asking Congress
  to create nationwide relief programs were viewed as callous disregard for the
  unemployed
