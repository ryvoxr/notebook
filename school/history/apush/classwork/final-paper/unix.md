Topic:
The UNIX operating system is a multitasking multi-user operating system
developed at AT&T's Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from the late
60s onwards. Not only did UNIX go on to inspire an entire family of operating
systems (which now run the entire internet), it also had a strong impact on
American society and technology.

I realise that this topic is not heavily referenced in the textbook or our
studies. If this topic is too offroad I have a backup topic prepared as well.
