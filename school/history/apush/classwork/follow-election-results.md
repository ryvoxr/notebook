## Observations

At around 9:00PM the Republicans had 2x the democrats in the house and for
governor.

There is a striking lack of representation of third parties... Like I couldn't
find them

The balance of power in the senate was exactly 50-50 before the election. I
believe that this means that the Democrats technically have the edge because
they have the Vice Pres... But I'm not sure.

## Questions

Under the Senate results at 9:00PM, the chart listed (2 other) under the
democrat side of the graph. What is that? Third parties.. Why would they count
them with the Democrats?
