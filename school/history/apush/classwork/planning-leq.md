# Planning a Long Essay (LEQ) for APUSH

## Analyze

## Brainstorm possible responses
Brainstorm evidence
- Organize into 2-3 categories
- Don't rewrite anything, just note which evidence connects to which category

## Brainstorm the historical context
Use historical context in your opening paragraph

## Draft Thesis
Write a draft of your thesis
- Answer the questions
- Lay out structure for the argument

First sentence -> Answer question in a broad way
Second sentence -> Specific categories

## Very brief outline
Topic and supporting evidence for each paragraph
- Just a few words

## Basic Essay Structure
- Intro paragraph, beginning with context and culminating in thesis statement
- 2-4 body paragraphs with topic sentences and evidence connecting back to the thesis statement
- Conclusion (taking a risk or making broader connection) - only if time allows
