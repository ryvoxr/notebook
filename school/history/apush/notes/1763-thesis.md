## To what extent did 1763 mark a turning-point in the relationship between the English colonists and Great Britain?

### 1. First, note your gut reaction to the prompt; it can even be useful to indicate this as a dot on a spectrum.
It was a turning point. Because of the debts from the Great war of Empire, England needed money. They created the Proclamation line of 1763, preventing colonists from settling past it.

### 2. Discuss with a partner and put evidence on two sides of a chart: It is a turning-point (Change) vs. It is not a turning-point (Continuity)
It is a turning-point | It is not a turning point
--- | ---
Prompted England to tax the colonies | There was already some tension between England and the colonies
Created the Proclamation line of 1763 | They were proud to be British 
Ended salutary neglect | 

### 3. Then, write a thesis...
Although the Americans were proud to be British, the creation of the Proclamation line of 1763 and the following taxes fundamentally changed the relationship between the English colonists and Great Britain.

### 4. It is important to know how to use "although" in a thesis. It is also important to recognize that a thesis can have two sentences, especially if one is turning out to be clunky.
