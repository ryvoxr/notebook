# Bacon's Rebellion

TL;DR: Poor people were upset and attacked the higher-ups (led by Nathaniel Bacon)

In the 1670s, economic and political power in Virginia was centralized in a few men who accumulated the majority of assets (land, slaves, political offices)
- They controlled nearly half of the land in Virginia
- Head of this group was William Berkeley, governor twice

Berkeley gave large land grants to members of his council
- Councilors exempted these lands from taxation and appointed friends in positions of power
- Bought off legislators with land and political offices
- Took away the right to vote from landless freemen

#### Nathaniel Bacon
Young, well-connected migrant form England
- Leader of the rebels
	- White and black indentured servants
	- Yeoman farmers
- Held a position on the governor's council, but was not in Berkeley's inner circle
- Disagreed with Berkeley on the issue of [[Native American|Native Americans]]
	- Lack of protection from attacks by Native groups
	- Rich people lived on the coast, poor people west


When the governor didn't give ham a military commission, he attacked the frontiersmen with his neighbors and any Natives willing
	- Resulted in the House of Burgesses reducing the powers of the governor and restoring the right to vote to landless freemen
