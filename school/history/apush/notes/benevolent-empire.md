# Benevolent Empire

## Establishment

Congregational and Presbyterian ministers created a network of organizations called the Benevolent Empire

## Goals
Their goal was to restore "the moral government of God"
- Reduce the consumption of alcohol and other vices that they believed resulted in poverty
- Tried to control the lives of working people

The Benevolent Empire targeted old-school bad things
- Drunkenness
- Adultery
- Prostitution
- Crime

Instead of relying on church sermons, they created large-scale organizations
- Prison Discipline Society
- general Union for Promoting the Observance of the Christian Sabbath
