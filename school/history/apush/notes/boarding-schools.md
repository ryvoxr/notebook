# Boarding Schools

Boarding schools were established for [[Native Nations]] in 1860
Bureau of Indian Affairs established the first Indian boarding school on the Yakima Indian reservation in Washington

These schools were established by well-intentioned reformers Herbert Welsh and Henry Pancoast
- The goal of these reformers was to use education as a tool to "assimilate" Indian tribes into the mainstream of the "American way of life"
- [[Native American]] would be taught the importance of private property, material wealth and nuclear families

The first priority of the boarding schools would be to provide the rudiments of academic education: reading, writing and speaking the English language

Religious training in [[Christianity]] would also be taught

By the 1880s, the [[United States]] operated 60 schools for 6200 [[Native American]] students

### "Kill the Indian, Save the Man"
It was felt that reservation schools were not sufficiently removed from the influences of tribal life
- In the eyes of the assimilationists, off-reservation boarding schools would be the best hope of changing [[Native American]] children into members of the white society
- For Col. Richard Henry Pratt, the goal was complete [[Assimilation|assimilation]] 
	- His motto was "Kill the Indian, Save the Man"
	- Believed that off-reservation schools established in white communities could accomplish this task
