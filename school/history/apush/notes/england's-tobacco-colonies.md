# England's Tobacco Colonies

## The Jamestown Settlement
Merchants took charge of English expansion

In 1606, King James granted the Virginia Company of London all the lands from NC to southern New York
- Named Virginia in memory of Elizabeth I, the never-married "Virgin Queen"
- Was a [[Joint-stock Corporation]]

Virginia Company dispatched an all-male group
- No ability to support itself
	- No women, farmers, or ministers
	- Hoped to demand tribute from the region's Indian population
- All they wanted was gold
	- There was no gold

Settled in swampy peninsula
- Named Jamestown to honor king
- 38 of 120 men were alive 9 months later

[[Native American|Native Americans]] there were more powerful than the Europeans expected
- They were the Powhatan
	- Group of 300 chiefdoms
- Willing to treat the English traders as allies who could provide goods
	- Expected tribute from the English
- Gave the English corn
	- Demanded “hatchets, bells, beads, copper, and two great guns”

Relations with the Native Americans went poorly
- Led to a decade of uneasy relations
- Followed by a long period of ruinous warfare
	- War was precipitated by the discovery of a [[Cash Crop|cash crop]] that gave the Europeans an opportunity to make the Indian's land profitable
	- Tobacco was very profitable

To encourage immigration, the Virginia Company allowed individual settlers to own land
- Granted 100 acres to every free man
	- More to those who imported servants
- Created a system of representative government
	- House of Burgesses
		- First met in 1619
		- Could make laws and levy taxes
		- Europe always had veto power

## The War of 1622

Influx of migrants started war with neighboring natives

Started with an assault by Powhatan's younger brother Opechancanough
- Attacked some of the first English invaders
- Would not be drawn to any [[Treaty]]
- Resisted English proposals to place Indian children in schools to be taught Christianity
- Wanted to get rid of the English

Opechancanough almost succeeded in wiping out the English
- In 1622, he coordinated an attack by 12 Indian chiefdoms that killed 347 English settlers
- English fought back
	- Seized fields and food of natives
	- Called natives "naked, tanned, deformed Savages"

James I revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony
- The king and his ministers appointed the governor and a small advisory council
- Retained the locally elected House of Burgesses
	- Stipulated that all the king's Privy Council must ratify all legislation

## Lord Baltimore Settles Catholics in Maryland

A second tobacco-growing colony developed in Maryland

King Charles I was sympathetic toward Catholicism
- Granted lands bordering the Chesapeake Bay to Catholic Aristocrat Cecilius Calvert
- Maryland became a refuge for Catholics
	- Catholics were subject to prosecution in England
	- 20 gentlemen (Catholic) and 200 artisans and laborers (Protestant)
		- Established St. Mary's City at the mouth of the Potomac River
		- To minimize religious confrontations, the proprietor instructed the governor to not blame the Protestants, and to make the Catholics practice in peace

Maryland grew quickly because Baltimore imported many artisans
- Offered lots of lands to wealthy migrants
- Political conflict threatened the colony's stability
- Lord Baltimore persuaded the assembly to enact the Toleration Act
	- Grated all Christians the right to follow their beliefs and hold church services

Tobacco quickly became the main crop
