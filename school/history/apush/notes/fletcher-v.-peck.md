# Fletcher v. Peck

In 1795 the Georgia legislature sold 35 million acres for 1.5 cents per acre
- Every legislature voting for it had been bribed
- Georgia voters wanted to repeal the grant
	- The land was already sold several times

[[John Marshall]] argued that if a state legislature could arbitrarily void property contracts it would be really bad
- Protection of entreprenurial spirit

Full defense of personal property rights
- No state could retroactively invalidate a private contract
- Limits the legislatures of the states
- Extended contact protection to public as well as private contracts
