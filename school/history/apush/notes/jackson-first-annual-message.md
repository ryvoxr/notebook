## Main points

US already made a provision for them
- Made an Indian territory in the Louisiana purchase
- US is actually doing a good job

Integration should be voluntary

They had already tried to integrate into society
- Many were not cooperative

## Boudinot Response

The US people called them savage

The Cherokees always had a government of their own
- People are punished for their crimes

Until now, they have followed all of the orders form US to try and be peaceful
