# Marbury v. Madison

Began with a act of partisanship by John Adams
- Singed commissions for federal judges
	- Papers had to be delivered to the justices

William Marbury asked [[John Marshall]] to compel Madison to deliver his commission
- Madison did not feel obliged to deliver the papers
- Supreme Court was shut down

Decision
- The Jefferson administration has illegally withheld your commission
- Not the proper tribunal to help you
- Jeffersonians had won
	- Wasn't such a big victory
- Supreme court did not have jurisdiction
	- Has to strike down an act of congress
