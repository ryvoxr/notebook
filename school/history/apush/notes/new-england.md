## Early Colonization

In 1620 English Protestants arrived at Plymouth

By 1640, they had more than 20,00 migrants
- Not parties of young male adventurers
- Came in family groups to create communities like the ones they left behind
- They intended to establish them according to Protestant principles
	- As John Calvin had done in Geneva

Their numbers were small compared to the Caribbean and Chesapeake
- Their balanced sex ration and organized approach to community allowed them to multiply quickly
- Distributed land broadly
	- built a society of independent farm families
- Established a holy commonwealth
	- Gave a moral dimension to American history

#### The Pilgrims
- Lacked a royal charter
	- Combined themselves "together into a civil body politick"
		- The Mayflower Compact used the Pilgrim's self-governing religious congregation as the model for their political structure

Only half of the first group survived until spring
- After that, Plymouth thrived
	- Cold climate stopped the spread of mosquito-borne disease
	- The Pilgrims religious discipline encouraged a strong work ethic

#### The Puritans
The Puritan exodus began in 1630
- Departure of 900 migrants led by John Winthrop
	- Well educated country squire
	- He sought land for his children and a place in Christian history for his people

Winthrop and his people governed the Massachusetts Bay Colony from the town of Boston
- Like the Virginia company
	- Representative political system with a governor
	- Limited the right to vote and hold office to men who were church members
- Established Puritanism as the state-supported religion

#### Roger Williams
To maintain God's favor, the Massachusetts Bay magistrates removed anyone against their faith
- A main target was Roger Williams

He opposed the decision to establish an official religion and praised the Pilgrims' separation of church and state
- Advocated for toleration
- Argued that political magistrates had authority only over the bodies, goods, and outward estates of men
- Also questioned the Puritans' seizure of Indian lands

The magistrates banished him from the colony in 1636

#### Anne Hutchinson
Was a second threat to the magistrates' authority

The wife of a merchant and a mother of seven
- Held weekly prayer meetings for women
- Accused Boston clergymen for placing emphasis on good behavior
- Denied that salvation could only be earned through good deeds
- Thought that God saved those who were predestined for salvation

#### Puritan-Pequot War
Started when a group of Massachusetts and Connecticut militiamen attacked a Pequot village
- New Englanders drove the surviving Pequots apart

The puritans believed that their church should embrace all peoples
- Strong emphasis on predestination
	- God saved only a few chosen people
	- Did not consider the natives to be part of the predestined people
