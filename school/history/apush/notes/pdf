<h1 id="lyman-beecher">Lyman Beecher</h1>
<p>Presbyterian minister, father of thirteen (powerful) children,
strongly opposed to intemperance.</p>
<h2 id="temperance">Temperance</h2>
<p>Intemperance -&gt; alcohol intoxication or drunkenness</p>
<p>Source of concern in New England and other areas of the US - Heavy
drinking occurred even at some formal meetings of clergy</p>
<p>Beecher resolved to make a stand against it - Delivered and published
six sermons on intemperance - Sent throughout the US - Ran some editions
in England - Translated into several languages in Europe - Still being
sold 50 years later</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-and-occasions-of-intemperance">The Nature and
Occasions of Intemperance</h2>
<p>“Look not thou upon the wine when it is red… At the last it biteth
like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.” - Effects of alcohol -&gt;
biting like a snake and singing like a viper</p>
<p>“Thine eye shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter
perverse things” - Effects of alcohol -&gt; Thinking “perverse”
things</p>
<p>It’s smiling deceptions in the beginning, and serpent-bite in the end
- Helplessness of its victims - Dangerous - “Like that of one who sleeps
upon the top of a mast”</p>
<p>No sin has fewer apologies (is more blatant) than intemperance -
Suffrage of the world is against it - There is no sin indicated by so
many signs</p>
<p>“Theft and falsehood are definite actions. But intemperance is a
state of internal sensation” - Intemperance is not a direct choice -&gt;
it is a reaction to a sensation - Indications may exist long, and
multiply, and the subject may not be aware that they are the signs of
intemperance</p>
<p>Intemperance comes with prosperity</p>
<p>The use of alcohol to stimulate “does violence to the laws of his
(God’s) nature)” - Puts the whole system into disorder - Affects
sensibility and intellect on awakening</p>
