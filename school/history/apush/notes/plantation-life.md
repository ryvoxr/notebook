# Plantation Life

Plantations were initially small freeholds
- Farms of 30 to 50 acres owned and farmed by families or male partners

The logic of plantation agriculture soon encouraged consolidation
	- Large planters collected as much land as they could
	- Experimented with new forms of labor that maximized their control over production
	- The headright system guaranteed 50 acres of land to anyone who paid the passage of a new immigrant to the colony
		- by buying additional indentured servants and slaves, the colony's largest planters also amassed ever greater claims to land

European demand for tobacco set off a forty-year economic boom
- "All our riches for the present do consist in tobacco"

## Indentured Servitude

The prospect of owning land continued to lure settlers
- By 1700, more than 100,000 English migrants had come to Virginia and Maryland
- Over 200,000 had migrated to the islands of the West Indies

3/4 of registrants were young men
- They came to Bristol searching for work
- Merchants persuaded them to sign contracts to labor in America
	- Indentured servitude contracts bound the men to work for a master for four or five years
	- After which, they were free to marry and work for themselves

For Merchants servants were valuable
- Their contracts fetched high prices for planters

For Plantation owners it was lucky if their indentured servants survived the voyage
- They also often died during their first year in a harsh new disease environment
	- Called seasoning
- During the Chesapeake's tobacco boom a male servant could produce five times his purchase price in a single year
	- To maximize their gains, many masters exploited servants
		- Forced them to work long hours
		- Beat them without cause
		- Withheld permission to marry

## African Laborers

Blacks quickly outnumbered whites in Barbados where there was large sugar production
- White slave owners were developing a code of force and terror to keep producing sugar
- First legislation about slaves  was "Act for the better ordering and governing of Negroes"
