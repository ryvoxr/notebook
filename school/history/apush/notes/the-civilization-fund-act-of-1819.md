Had the goal of infusing the country's [[Native American|indigenous people]] with "good moral character"

Tasked Christian missions and the government with teaching Native American children western subjects
- Was an effort to eradicate America's original cultural identity
- Countless Native American children were taken and placed in faraway boarding schools
	- Often traumatic and degrading

Stressed that the boarding schools were only to enroll Native students who gave consent
- The government often coerced children's families via threats and police seizures

> “The full effect of the boarding school system wouldn’t be understood until decades after the agenda of ‘civilizing the savage’ ground down” - Treuer
