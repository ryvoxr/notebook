>But as a Native person, I know that for every kid you find, say, standing in a pile of garbage, there are 20, 30, 40, 100 other kids selling Girl Scout cookies or going to tennis lessons or doing their homework or competing on the mat team or getting excited about prom-often while also going to ceremony, for example, and speaking Lakota and engaging in other cultural customs.

Even though modern [[Native American]] children are still living their lives, they also participate heavily with their culture
- They go to ceremony
- They speak Lakota
- They engage in other cultural customs
