# What a School Could have been Established
##### Luther Standing Bear

Grew up as a traditional member of his people:
- Learned the crafts of hunter, scout, warrior, kindness, respect for wisdom, council, and the devotional rites of the Great Mystery
- At the age of 11, ancestral life abruptly ended
- By 1879, his people were no longer free, but were subjects confined on reservations under the rule of agent

Decided voluntarily to go east with the "white people"
- He thought that the only reason that they would want him to go east was to die
- Courage and bravery had been trained into him
- Most [[Lakota]] men preferred to die in the performance of some act of bravery than to die of old age

### The "Civilizing Process"
It began with clothes
- Seen that they "could not be civilized while wearing the moccasin and blanket"
- Accustomed dress was taken and replaced with clothing that felt cumbersome and awkward
- Trousers and handkerchiefs
	- They were unsanitary
	- Trousers kept them from breathing well
	- High collars, stiff-bosomed shirts, and suspenders fully three inches in width were uncomfortable, while leather boots cause actual suffering

Forced to not only accept new ideas and adopt new manners, but actual physical changes and discomfort had to be borne until their bodies adjusted themselves to new tastes and habits

Names were changed
- Instead of translating our names into English, they were just named random English names
- He selected Luther at random

It was forbidden to speak their native tongue
- Robs [[Native American|Native Americans]] of a large part of their culture and history
- A language that is only seen embalmed in books, is a dead language
- Only the people themselves, and never the scholars can nourish it into life

Dietary changes
- Of all the changes, the diet was the most injurious
	- Immediate and drastic
- White bread, coffee, and sugar replaced their usual diet of meat, fruit, and vegetables

### Assimilation
His father spoke to him, after receiving permission, for the first time in a year
