# APUSH Summer Reading Assignment for Fall 2022
I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help on this assignment

## Part 1
1. What are treaties?
	- Treaties are agreements between two nations
	- A treaty must be made between two sovereign nations and the US Constitution
	- These treaties do not grant the right to land or freedom
	- They were used by the United States to assert their sovereignty after the Revolutionary War with Great Britain
	- The Constitution holds treaties with the force of a statue, although not of super-constitution
3. Why do the indigenous lawyers and scholars in the video suggest they are so important, both historically and today, in 2022?
	- They represent the promises that were made
	- Although some disregard them as a thing of the past, they still have the full force of the law behind them; and should be respected as such

## Part 2
4. How did the piece by Luther Standing Bear deepen your understanding of the Boarding School Era?
	- The piece explored a first-person recounting of Luther Standing Bear's experience with the Boarding Schools era
	- It explicated in depth the "civilizing process" and the strict customs and behavior that he was forced to assimilate with
5. Make a bulleted list of at least for actions that symbolized giving up the so-called "uncivilized" ways of the Lakota and adopting the "civilized" ways of European-American whites
	- Clothes
		- Seen that they "could not be civilized while wearing the moccasin and blanket"
		- Accustomed dress was taken and replaced with clothing that felt cumbersome and awkward
		- Trousers and handkerchiefs
			- They were unsanitary
			- Trousers kept them from breathing well
			- High collars, stiff-bosomed shirts, and suspenders fully three inches in width were uncomfortable, while leather boots cause actual suffering
	- Forced to not only accept new ideas and adopt new manners, but actual physical changes and discomfort had to be borne until their bodies adjusted themselves to new tastes and habits
	- Names were changed
		- Instead of translating our names into English, they were just named random English names
		- He selected Luther at random
	- It was forbidden to speak their native tongue
		- Robs Native Americans of a large part of their culture and history
		- A language that is only seen embalmed in books, is a dead language
		- Only the people themselves, and never the scholars can nourish it into life
	- Dietary changes
		- Of all the changes, the diet was the most injurious
			- Immediate and drastic
		- White bread, coffee, and sugar replaced their usual diet of meat, fruit, and vegetables
6. According to Luther Standing Bear, what are some of the ways in which Native peoples resisted these practices?
	- They changed into their uncomfortable and alien clothes just before inspection

## Part 3
Read the article, "The Schools That Tried--But Failed to Make Native Americans Obsolete" by David Treuer:
7. In what ways does Treuer highlight the *resilience* of Native American culture today, even in the face of oppressive U.S. policies over time? Give at least three examples
	- They go to ceremony
	- They speak Lakota
	- They engage in other cultural customs
