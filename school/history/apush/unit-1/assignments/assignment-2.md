# Assignment 2

## What was the Columbian Exchange? Define and describe it in your own words.

The Columbian Exchange was the transfer of agriculture, disease, ideas, and
technology between the Old and New worlds.

## What impact did the exchange have on the Americas? Discuss at least three examples. Which seems most significant, and why?

### Agriculture

Old World:
- Wheat, barley, rice, turnips
- Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, cattle

New World:
- Maize, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, manioc
- Llama, alpaca, dog, fowl, guinea pig

The Europeans who settled on the east coast of the New World cultivated crops
like wheat and apples
- Also brought European weeds
- Couch grass, dandelion, shepherd's purse, groundsel, sow thistle, chickweeds
- Plantains: Englishman's foot

### Disease

Old World did not have pathogens associated with the Old World's dense
populations

New World:
- Animals carried disease: chickens, cattle, black rats, mosquitoes
- Smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenzas, malaria, yellow fever

Native Americans "began to die quickly"
- Thousands of natives died in a great plague
- Smallpox was the worst of the infectious diseases
- The first recorded pandemic of smallpox in British North America spread
  quickly among the Algonquin of Massachusetts in the 1630's

Europeans encountered American illnesses
- Chagas Disease, Veneral syphilis
- These did not have much effect on Old World populations


The transfer of diseases seems to be the most significant
- Without the diseases brought to the New World by the Europeans, it is
  possible that the Native Americans might have stood (more of) a chance
  against them
    - This could also completely be wrong. To be fair, the Europeans did have
      guns

## According to Crosby, what aspect of the exchange has the greatest impact on the "Old World"? Why does he argue this?

The aspect of the exchange that had the greatest impact on the Old World is
agriculture
- Maize, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, various squashes, chilies, and manioc
  have become essentials in the diets of Europeans, Africans, and Asians
- The new agriculture and dietary options could explain the global population
  explosion that happened afterwards

## According to Nash, how did the European and Native American worldviews differ at the time of contact? Be sure to highlight at least three areas.

### Relationship with the Earth

#### European view

1. The natural world was a resource for man to use
2. "Subdue the earth" and "have dominion over every living thing that moves on
   the earth" from Genesis
3. Although religion was still immensely important, man's relationship to his
   natural environment fell into the secular sphere

#### Native American view

1. No separation of secular and sacred
2. Every part of the natural world was sacred
3. Native Americans believed the world as inhabited by a variety of "beings"
- Each possessing spiritual power and linked together
- "Plants, animals, rocks, and stars are thus seen not as objects governed by
  the laws of nature but as 'fellows' with whom the individual or band may have
  a more or less advantageous relationship"

### Private property

#### European view

1. Private ownership of property became one of the fundamental values of
   European culture
2. Fences were symbols of exclusively held property
3. Inheritance was how these assets were transferred from one generation to
   another within the same family

#### Native American view

1. Tribes recognized territorial boundaries
- Between these limits the land was shared
2. Land was not a commodity but a part of nature
3. Everything was the property of the Creator
- Land was a gift of the Creator
	- To be used with care
	- Not for the possession of humans

### Personal identity

#### European view

1. Acquisitive, competitive, enhanced the role of the individual
2. Wide choice for the individual to improve his status
- Industriousness, valor, personal sacrifice were regarded as desirable
- Personal ambition

#### Native American view

Collectivity rather than the individual
- Land and other natural resources were held in common and society was less
  hierarchical
    - The accumulative spirit and personal ambition were inappropriate
    - Individualism was likely to lead to ostracism rather than admiration
