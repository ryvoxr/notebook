# Assignment 3

## What is a joint-stock corporation? What is a royal colony? How are they different from one another?

A joint stock corporation is a corporation that is funded by the pooled
resources of many investors (to spread the risk widely). A royal colony is
different because it is managed and overseen completely by England (the king).
In a Royal Colony, the king and his ministers appointed the governor and an
advisory council.

## How successful was early Jamestown as a settlement? What is a cash crop? What was the House of Burgesses?

### The Jamestown Settlement

Merchants took charge of English expansion

In 1606, King James granted the Virginia Company of London all the lands from
NC to southern New York
- Named Virginia in memory of Elizabeth I, the never-married "Virgin Queen"
- Was a Joint-stock Corporation

Virginia Company dispatched an all-male group
- No ability to support itself
    - No women, farmers, or ministers
    - Hoped to demand tribute from the region's Indian population
- All they wanted was gold
    - There was no gold

Settled in swampy peninsula
- Named Jamestown to honor king
- 38 of 120 men were alive 9 months later

Native American there were more powerful than the Europeans expected
- They were the Powhatan
    - Group of 300 chiefdoms
- Willing to treat the English traders as allies who could provide goods
    - Expected tribute from the English
- Gave the English corn
    - Demanded “hatchets, bells, beads, copper, and two great guns”

Relations with the Native Americans went poorly
- Led to a decade of uneasy relations
- Followed by a long period of ruinous warfare
    - War was precipitated by the discovery of a Cash Crop that gave the
      Europeans an opportunity to make the Indian's land profitable
    - Tobacco was very profitable

To encourage immigration, the Virginia Company allowed individual settlers to
own land
- Granted 100 acres to every free man
    - More to those who imported servants
- Created a system of representative government
    - House of Burgesses
        - First met in 1619
        - Could make laws and levy taxes
        - Europe always had veto power

A cash crop is a crop that was in high demand in Europe. It was especially
profitable for the country who harvested it due to the taxes they were able to
levy on it.

## What was special about Maryland?

A second tobacco-growing colony developed in Maryland

King Charles I was sympathetic toward Catholicism
- Granted lands bordering the Chesapeake Bay to Catholic Aristocrat Cecilius
  Calvert
- Maryland became a refuge for Catholics
    - Catholics were subject to prosecution in England
    - 20 gentlemen (Catholic) and 200 artisans and laborers (Protestant)
        - Established St. Mary's City at the mouth of the Potomac River
        - To minimize religious confrontations, the proprietor instructed the
          governor to not blame the Protestants, and to make the Catholics
          practice in peace

Maryland grew quickly because Baltimore imported many artisans
- Offered lots of lands to wealthy migrants
- Political conflict threatened the colony's stability
- Lord Baltimore persuaded the assembly to enact the Toleration Act
    - Grated all Christians the right to follow their beliefs and hold church
      services

Tobacco quickly became the main crop

## What was the headright system?

The headright system guaranteed 50 acres of land to anyone who paid the passage
of a new immigrant to the colony
- by buying additional indentured servants and slaves, the colony's largest
  planters also amassed ever greater claims to land

## Who were the gentry?

The gentry were wealthy migrants from noble families. They established large
estates and used indentured servants and slaves to work their lands.

## Define indentured servitude?

3/4 of registrants were young men
- They came to Bristol searching for work
- Merchants persuaded them to sign contracts to labor in America
    - Indentured servitude contracts bound the men to work for a master for
      four or five years
    - After which, they were free to marry and work for themselves

## Define or identify - Pilgrims, Puritans, Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson, the Puritan-Pequot War

### The Pilgrims

The Pilgrims were religious separatists
- Committed Protestants who had left the Church of England
- Lacked a royal charter
    - Combined themselves "together into a civil body politick"
        - The Mayflower Compact used the Pilgrim's self-governing religious
          congregation as the model for their political structure

Only half of the first group survived until spring
- After that, Plymouth thrived
    - Cold climate stopped the spread of mosquito-borne disease
    - The Pilgrims religious discipline encouraged a strong work ethic

### The Puritans

The Puritan exodus began in 1630
- Departure of 900 migrants led by John Winthrop
    - Well educated country squire
    - He sought land for his children and a place in Christian history for his
      people

Winthrop and his people governed the Massachusetts Bay Colony from the town of
Boston
- Like the Virginia company
    - Representative political system with a governor
    - Limited the right to vote and hold office to men who were church members
- Established Puritanism as the state-supported religion

### Roger Williams

To maintain God's favor, the Massachusetts Bay magistrates removed anyone
against their faith
- A main target was Roger Williams

He opposed the decision to establish an official religion and praised the
Pilgrims' separation of church and state
- Advocated for toleration
- Argued that political magistrates had authority only over the bodies, goods,
  and outward estates of men
- Also questioned the Puritans' seizure of Indian lands

The magistrates banished him from the colony in 1636

### Anne Hutchinson

Was a second threat to the magistrates' authority

The wife of a merchant and a mother of seven
- Held weekly prayer meetings for women
- Accused Boston clergymen for placing emphasis on good behavior
- Denied that salvation could only be earned through good deeds
- Thought that God saved those who were predestined for salvation

### Puritan-Pequot War

Started when a group of Massachusetts and Connecticut militiamen attacked a
Pequot village
- New Englanders drove the surviving Pequots apart

The puritans believed that their church should embrace all peoples
- Strong emphasis on predestination
    - God saved only a few chosen people
    - Did not consider the natives to be part of the predestined people
