## March on Washington

Rustin became involved in the March on Washington in 1962 when he was recruited
by Randolph

Rustin drilled off-duty police officers
- As marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium
  speakers

## New York City school boycott

Coordinated a citywide boycott of public schools to protest their de facto
segregation

The protest demanded complete integration of the city's schools and it
challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals

Rustin organized a March which called for "maximum possible integration
- "This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the
  construction of large schools and the replacement of junior high schools with
  middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the rally, yet
  only four thousand protestors showed up, and the Board of Education was no
  more responsive to the conciliatory demonstration than to the earlier, more
  confrontational boycott."

## Foreign policy

Rustin supported President Lyndon B. Johnson's containment policy against
communism
- Criticized specific conduct of the policy

Wanted to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in Vietnam
- Gave critical support to US military intervention in the Vietnam War

Rustin worked with the CIA sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the
Dominican Republic
- Len international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the
  socialist former president

## Labor movement

  economic justice for all Americans

Was the founder and Director of the A. Phillip Randolph Institute


Rustin Increased his visibility as a leader of the American movement for social
democracy
- Became a national co-chairman of the Socialist Party of America

Called for the Social Democrats USA to organize against the ":reactionary
policies of the Nixon Administration"

## Gay rights

Davis Platt Bayard's partner from the 1940s
- Said "I never had any sense at all the Bayard felt any shame or guilt about
  his homosexuality. That was rare in those days"

Rustin did not engage in an gay rights activism until the 1980s
- Urged to do so by his partner Walter Niggle
- Said that "I think that if I hadn't been in the office at that time, when
  those invitations [from gay organizations] came in, he probably wouldn't have
  done them."

Rustin testified in favor of New York State's Gay Rights Bill
- Gave a speech "The New Niggers Are Gays"
