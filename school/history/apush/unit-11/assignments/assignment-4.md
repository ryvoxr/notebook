# Assignment 4

## What were the causes and effects of the Energy Crisis?

Aggravated by US foreign policy in the Middle East

The United States was one of the world's leading oil producers
- Had become heavily dependent on inexpensive imported oil from the Persian Gulf
- The Persian Gulf states created a cartel to control oil prices (Organization
  of Petroleum Exporting Countries -> OPEC)

Produced fuel shortages

The US scrambled to meet its energy needs in the face of the oil shortage
- Congress imposed a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour to conserve fuel
- Americans began buying smaller more fuel-efficient cars

## What environmental legislation was passed in this period?

"The energy crisis drove home the realization that the earth's resources are
not limitless." - The Textbook
- That doesn't seem like a reasonable conclusion given what caused the energy crisis
- A literal cartel formed to regulate oil prices... How is that related to the
  environment... We weren't running out of oil then

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- Required developers to file environmental impact statements assessing the
  effect of their projects on ecosystems

1. Clean Air Act (1970)
2. EPA
3. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA violation moment)
4. Endangered Species Act

Nuclear Power
- "anti-nuclear propaganda" - The Textbook

## Explain stagflation, deindustrialization, and the economic woes of the US in the 1970s.

Government spending in Vietnam and the Great Society created a massive federal
deficit
- Inflation skyrocketed because of legalized counterfeit (The Federal Reserve
  and fiat) and OPEC embargo

Stagflation is inflation in a stagnant economy
- Artificial price or supply setting via an embargo, government regulations, or
  both
- If supply goes down (as is the case with an embargo) prices will go up
  (inflation) but not because of increased demand. Less demand will occur
  because of higher prices and little demand causes a rather stagnant economy

## What was the “tax revolt” and Proposition 13 in California?

Dramatic reversal of the postwar spirit of generous public investment


In California...
- Inflation pushed real estate values upwards and property taxes skyrocketed

Proposition 13 was an initiative that would roll back property taxes, cap
future increases for present owners, and require that all tax measures have a
two-thirds majority in the legislature
- Hobbled public spending in California
