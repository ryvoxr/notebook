## Who made up the Reagan coalition?

"Concentrated power has always been the enemy of liberty"

"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the
government, and I'm here to help'"

The Reagan coalition
- Joined by a large and electorally key group of former Democrats that had
  begun gradually moving toward the Republican Party since 1964
- Reagan capitalized on the "souther strategy" developed by Richard Nixon

Endorsed states' rights
- He endorsed souther opposition to federal civil rights legislation

Moral Majority
- Claimed that it had registered two million new voters for the 1980 election
- Called for a constitutional ban on abortion, voluntary prayer in public
  schools, and a mandatory death penalty for certain crimes

Attracted the allegiance of another group dissatisfied with the direction of
liberalism in the 1970s
- Blue collar voters
- High number of Catholics
- Alarmed by antiwar protesters and rising welfare expenditures and hostile to
  feminist demands

## What was “Reaganomics”? Include a discussion of deregulation
## Take notes on the economy and culture of the 1980s

To increase the production of goods

Supply-side economics
- Emphasized investment in productive enterprises
- The best way to bolster investment was t reduce the taxes paid by
  corporations and wealthy Americans, who could then use those funds to expand
  production

Resulting economic expansion would increase government revenues and offset the
loss of tax dollars stemming from the original tax cuts
- The increasing supply would generate its own demand as consumers stepped
  forward to buy more goods

Reagan took advantage of Republican control of the Senate to win congressional
approval of the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act
- Massive tax cut that embodied supply-side economics as an alternative to the
  slow-growth, recession oriented policies of the Carter Administration
- Also slashed estate taxies
- Trimmed the taxes paid by business corporations by $150 billion
- By 1986 the annual revenue of the federal government had been cut by $200
  billion

## How did Reagan handle the judiciary? HIV/AIDS?

Reagan appointed 368 federal court judges and three Supreme Court justices
- Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy

Limited the reach of federal laws
- Ending court-ordered busing
- Endorsed constitutional protection of property rights

O'Connor took a centrist approach

"However, on controversial issues such as individual liberties, abortion
rights, affirmative action, and the rights of criminal defendants, the presence
of O'Connor ensured that the Court adopted a more centrist position"
