# Unit 2, Assignment 8

#### Annapolis Convention
Delegates from five states met in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1786
- Met to consider solutions to the confederation's economic problems
- Planned another convention with representatives from all of the states
- Only an "efficient plan from the Convention can prevent anarchy first & civil convulsions afterwards" - James Madison

#### Philadelphia Convention
55 delegates from all of the states (except for Rhode Island) met in Philadelphia in 1787
- People were educated and propertied
	- Merchants, settlers, or tenants
- The absence of experienced leaders and contrary-minded delegates allowed capable younger nationalists to set the agenda
	- Declared that the convention would "decide for ever the fate of Republican Government"

#### Virginia Plan
Decided not to revise the Articles of Confederation, but rather to consider the Virginia Plan
- Scheme for a powerful national government devised by James Madison
	- Madison was determined to create national political institutions run by men of high character

Differed greatly from the Articles of Confederation:
- Rejected state sovereignty in favor of the "supremacy of national authority"
	- Power to overturn state laws
- Called for the national government to be established by the people, not the states
	- National laws to operate directly on citizens of the states
- Proposed a three-tier election system
	- Ordinary voters would elect only the lower house of the national legislature
	- Lower house would select the upper house

#### New Jersey Plan
Delegates from Delaware and other small states devised a plan
- Gave the Confederation the power to raise revenue, control commerce, and make binding requisitions on the states
- Each state would have one vote in a unicameral legislature

#### Great Compromise
Connecticut delegates suggested a possible compromise
- National Senate have 2 members from each state (regardless of size)
- And the House of Representatives be representative of the size of the state (with regard to size)

Restricting the extent of central authority

#### Slavery related compromises in the Constitution
Recognized that slavery contradicted republican principles and hoped for its eventual demise
- Supported an end to American participation in the Atlantic slave trade
- SC and Georgia declined angrily

Slavery related compromises:
- "fugitive clause" allowed masters to reclaim enslaved blacks who fled to other states
- excluded the words slavery and slave from the Constitution
	- Instead: Citizens, and all other Persons
- 3/5ths Clause
	- Northerners wanted slaves not to count because they couldn't vote
	- Southerners, ironically, wanted them to count because they had a lot of them

#### Antifederalists
Opponents of the Constitution
- Feared that state governments would lose power
- Lacked a declaration of individual rights
- Feared that the central government would be run by wealthy men

#### Ratification process
States debated ratification in ratification conventions
- Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut hoped that the power of a strong central government would offset the power of the surrounding large states
- In the Spring, Federalists won over Maryland, South Carolina, and New Hampshire
	- Reached the nine-state quota required for ratification
