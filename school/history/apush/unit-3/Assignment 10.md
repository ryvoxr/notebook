# Unit 3, Assignment 10

#### Machine tools
American craftsmen pioneered the development of machine tools
- Machines that made parts for other machines
- Eli Whitney was a key innovator
	- At 14, he made nails and knife blades
	- Made women's hairpins
	- Went to Yale
	- Capitalized on his expertise to create the cotton gin
	
#### Mass production
Making a crap-ton of stuff efficiently so can sell cheap or with really good margins

Reasonably priced products  such as rifles, sewing machines, and locks became household names

#### Unions
More and more workers became wage earners who labored under the control of an employer
- Unlike young women, men bridled at their status as supervise wage workers
- To assert their independence, male wage workers rejected the traditional terms of master and servant and used the Dutch word boss to refer to their employer

Wage earners banded together to form unions
- They faced a legal hurdle
- English and American common made such groups illegal
	- unions interfered with a "master's
	   authority over his "servant"
	   accused of "conspiring" to raise wages
	   
#### Newly developed cities and towns
The expansion of industry and trade dramatically increased America's urban population
- In 1820, there were 58 towns with more than 2,500 inhabitants
	- By 1840 there were 126 towns like that

Fastest growth occurred in the new industrial towns that sprouted along the "fall line"
- Where rivers descended rapidly from the Appalachian Mountains to the coastal plain

#### Social classes in the South (planters, yeomen, slaves)
The cotton boom sharpened distinctions between poorer and wealthier whites and concentrated slaves on larger plantations
- Tobacco and rice planting in the South had created a three tiered slave society

To increase cotton output, they used a rigorous gang-labor system
- Before, many planters had supervised workers only sporadically 
- Now masters with twenty or more slaves had disciplined teams, or "gangs" regulate and maintain order


#### Social classes in the North (business elite, middle class, workers)
Distinct social classes
- Small but wealthy business elite
- Substantial middle class
- Mass of propertyless wage earners

By creating a class-divided society, industrialization posed a momentous challenge to America's republican ideals
