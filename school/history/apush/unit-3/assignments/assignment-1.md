## What important decisions were made and precedents were set by the first Congress and President?

President possessed great personal dignity and a cautious personality
- To maintain continuity, he adopted many of the administrative practices of
  the Confederation
- Asked Congress to reestablish the existing executive departments:
    - Foreign Affairs, Finance, War
    - Thomas Jefferson -> Department of State
    - Alexander Hamilton -> Secretary of the Treasury
    - Henry Knox -> Secretary of War

The Constitution mandated a supreme court, but the Philadelphia convention gave
Congress the task of creating a national court system
- The Federalists wanted strong national institutions
- The Judiciary Act of 1789 reflected their vision
    - Established a federal district court in each state and three circuit
      courts to hear appeals from the district
    - The Supreme Court has the final say

## Explain Hamilton's Financial Plan (Reports on the Public Credit, on the National Bank, and on Manufactures)

Hamilton asked Congress to redeem $55 million in Confederation securities held
by investors
- As a new, undeveloped nation, they needed good credit
  (credibility/reliability/trust) to get loans
- Hamilton's redemption plan would give lots of money to speculators who had
  bought up deprecated securities
- Further enhance public credit by assuming the war debts of the states
    - Costed $22 million favored creditors
    - Very controversial
        - Especially in the southern states where they had very little debt or
          had already paid it off
		
Asked Congress to charter the Bank of the United States
- Would be jointly owned by private stockholders and the national government
- Argued that the bank would provide stability to the specie-starved American
  economy by making loans to merchants, handling government funds, and issuing
  bills of credit

## What was Jefferson's agrarian vision of the US?

Hamilton's financial measures had split the Federalists into opposed factions
- Norther Federalists supported the treasury secretary -> Federalists
- Southern Federalists agreed with Madison and Jefferson -> Democratic
  Republicans

Jefferson set his democratic vision of America in a society of independent
farmers
- "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God"
- The grain and meat from their homesteads would feed European nations
    - Turmoil in Europe helped bring about Jefferson's vision
        - The French Revolution began in 1789
        - Wheat prices leapt from 5 to 8 shillings

## What impact did the French Revolution have on Americans? In 1793 President

Washington issued a Proclamation of Neutrality
- Allowed all US citizens to trade with all belligerents
- As neutral carriers, American merchant ships claimed a right to pass through
  Britain's naval blockade

## What was the Whiskey Rebellion?

In 1794, western Pennsylvanian farmers mounted the Whiskey Rebellion
- Protested Hamilton's excise ta on spirits
    - Tax had cut demand for the corn whiskey the farmers distill 
- Like the Sons of Liberty in 1765
- "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"

## What did Jay's Treaty accomplish? What did it fail to accomplish?

Britain's maritime strategy intensified political divisions in America
- Beginning in 1793, the British navy seized 250 American ships carrying
  French sugar and other goods
- Hoping to get the goods diplomatically, Washington dispatched John Jay to
  Britain
    - Jay returned with a controversial treaty that ignored the American claim
      that "free ships make free goods" and accepted Britain's right to stop
      neutral ships
    - Also required the US gov to make compensation to British merchants for
      pre-Revolutionary War debts owed by American citizens
    - Despite the controversy, Jay's treaty was ratified

## How did the Haitian Revolution impact the US?

Thousands of refugees, planters, slaves, and free blacks fled and traveled to
Charleston, Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York
- Slave holders were scared that the idea of black liberation would undermine
  their own slave regimes
- Adams, not liking the French and being anti-slavery, aided the rebels and
  strengthened commercial ties
