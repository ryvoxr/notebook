# Jay's Treaty -> 1793

Beginning in 1793, the British navy seized 250 American ships carrying French
sugar and other goods
- Washington dispatched Jay to try and get the goods diplomatically
- Jay returned with a controversial treaty that ignored the American claim that
  "free ships make free goods" and accepted Britain's right to stop neutral
  ships
- Also required the US gov to make compensation to British merchants for
  pre-Revolutionary War debts owed by American citizens
- Despite the controversy, Jay's treaty was ratified
