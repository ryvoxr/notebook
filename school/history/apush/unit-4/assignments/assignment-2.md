# Assignment 2

## Describe the experience of free African Americans.

Lived primarily in coastal cities
- Mobile, Memphis, New Orleans, and Upper South

Formed the backbone of the urban artisan workforce
- Carpenters, barbers, blacksmiths, butchers, and shopkeepers

Faced many dangers
- White officials often denied jury trials to free blacks accused of crimes
- Sometimes they forced people charged with vagrancy back into slavery
- Some blacks distanced themselves from plantation slaves and assimilated white
  culture and value
    - For opportunity and protection

## Take notes on Nat Turner’s Revolt, the American Anti-Slavery Society, and the Underground Railroad.

Staged a chronological coincidence that had far-reaching consequences
- Turner had taught himself to read and hoped for emancipation
- One master forced him into the fields while another separated him from his
  wife
- Becoming deeply spiritual, turner had a religious vision in which "the
  Spirit" explained that "Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the
  sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent"

In August of 1831, rose in rebellion
- Killed at least 55 white men, women, and children
- Seeking to seize weapons from a nearby armory and take up a defensive
  position in the Great Dismal Swamp

Sowed terror across the South
- American Colonization Society became wildly popular
- "Representative of the violence inherent in the system!"
- "You see him repressing me!"
- "Help I'm being repressed."
- "Bloody peasant." - "Oh, that's a dead giveaway"
- I profusely apologize for digressing into Holy Grail jokes

## Discuss the resistance faced by abolitionists.

Racial fears and hatreds led to violent mob actions
- In 1829, working-class whites in Cincinnati drove over a thousand blacks form
  the city
- There was an 1807 law that had banned all blacks from Ohio

Banned al abolitionist writings, sermons, and lectures
- Offered reward for people who could catch abolitionist
- Mob attacked a post office and destroyed sacks of abolitionist mail

## Take notes on the Women’s Rights movement.

Women formed a crucial part of the Second Great Awakening and the Benevolent
Empire
- More than 70 percent of the members of New England Congregational churches
  were women
- The predominance of women prompted Congregational ministers to end
  traditional gender-segregated prayer meetings

Mixing men and women in religious activities promoted greater self-discipline

Men tried to curb their power
- Evangelical Baptist churches that had once advocated spiritual equality now
  prevented women from voting on church matters
- "Let your women learn to keep silence in the churches"
    - "She's a witch!"
    - "How do we know if she is a witch?"- "Build a bridge out of her!!"
    - "She turned me into a newt... It got better"
    - Once again, I digress
