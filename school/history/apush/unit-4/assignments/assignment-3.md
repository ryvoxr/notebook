## Give three examples of the rise of democracy in the first half of the 19th century.

1. Maryland reformers in the 1810's invoked the equal rights rhetoric of republicanism
    - Property qualifications for voting were a "tyranny"
    - New voters voted for those who dressed simply and endorsed popular rule
2. Constitutions of Indiana, Illinois, and Alabama prescribed a broad male
   franchise, and voters usually elected middling men to local and state
   offices
    - Men from modest backgrounds restricted imprisonment for debt, kept taxes
      low, and allowed farmers to claim squatters' rights to unoccupied land
3. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York wrote more democratic constitutions
    - Reapportioned legislative districts on the basis that judges would be
      elected (not appointed)
 

## Who was Van Buren? How did he create the first political machine?

## Explain republican motherhood

Traditionally most American women spent their adult life working as farmwives
and taking care of children

Women accepted greater responsibility for the welfare of the family

Republican motherhood -> "Preserving virtue and instructing the young are not
the fancied, but the real 'Rights of Women'"
