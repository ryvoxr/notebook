# Assignment 4

## Jackson’s use of patronage

Jackson relied on his "Kitchen Cabinet" to make policy:
- Francis Preston Blair -> edited the *Washington Globe*
- Amos Kendall -> wrote Jackson's speeches
- Roger B. Taney -> attorney general, treasury secretary, and chief justice
- Martin Van Buren -> secretary of state

Used patronage to create a disciplined national party
- Rejected the idea of "property in office"
    - a qualified official held a position permanently

Insisted on a rotation of officeholders when new administration took power
- Rotation would not lessen expertise
- public duties were "so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily
  qualify themselves for their performance"
- Government jobs were like the spoils of war:
    - "to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy"

## Jackson’s position on the American System and evidence of this position

Highest priority was to destroy the American System
- government-sponsored plans for national economic development were
  unconstitutional
    - the "voice of the people" called for "economy in the expenditures of the
      Government"

Vetoed for internal improvement bills in 1830
- Denied an extension of the National Road -> infringed on "the reserved powers
  of states"
- By eliminating expenses he also undermined the case for protective tariffs
    - "Destroy internal improvements and you leave no motive for the tariff
    
## South Carolina’s Act of nullification                          

The Tariff of 1828 had helped Jackson win the presidency
- Also put him in a major political crisis
- There was fierce opposition to high tariffs throughout the South

Congress reenacted the Tariff of Abominations in 1932
- South Carolina called a state convention that adopted an Ordinance of
  Nullification declaring the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 to be null and void
- The ordinance prohibited the collection of those duties in South Carolina

## The bank veto and the “bank war”

Jackson had a major challenge from politicians who supported the Second Bank of
the United States
- The bank was privately managed and operated under a government charter
    - Government owned 20% of its stock
- Bank was made to stabilize tha nation's money supply

Henry Clay and Daniel Webster wanted to extend the bank's charter
- Hoped to force Jackson into a veto that would split the Democrats

Clay and Webster's plan backfired
- Jackson vetoed the rechartering bill masterfully 
- Declared that Congress had no constitutional authority to charter a national
  bank
- Condemned the bank as "subversive of the rights of the States"
- Killed the bank
