## Temperance

Intemperance -> alcohol intoxication or drunkenness

    - Still being sold 50 years later

## The Nature and Occasions of Intemperance

"Look not thou upon the wine when it is red... At the last it biteth like a
serpent and stingeth like an adder."
- Effects of alcohol -> biting like a snake and singing like a viper

"Thine eye shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse
things"
- Effects of alcohol -> Thinking "perverse" things

It's smiling deceptions in the beginning, and serpent-bite in the end
- Helplessness of its victims
- Dangerous
    - "Like that of one who sleeps upon the top of a mast"

No sin has fewer apologies (is more blatant) than intemperance
- Suffrage of the world is against it
- There is no sin indicated by so many signs

"Theft and falsehood are definite actions. But intemperance is a state of
internal sensation"
- Intemperance is not a direct choice -> it is a reaction to a sensation
- Indications may exist long, and multiply, and the subject may not be aware
  that they are the signs of intemperance

Intemperance comes with prosperity

The use of alcohol to stimulate "does violence to the laws of his (God's) nature)"
- Puts the whole system into disorder
- Affects sensibility and intellect on awakening
