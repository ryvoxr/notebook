## Western Trails

Moved west for following reasons:
- For land
- Speculators => Wealthier going to buy big chunks of land
- Squatters => Go out to stake a claim in a smaller piece of land
- Navy published a glowing report of Oregon
- Exploration and gold
- Mormons were being discriminated against
    - Move west into Utah

Everybody started in Independence Missouri

### Manifest Destiny

"To present the country this way was desirable.. The map shows at a glance the
whole extent of the United States territory from sea to sea. In tracing the
probable expansion of the human race from east to west, the mind finds an
agreeable resting place on its western limits. The view is complete and
leaves nothing to be wished for. It also adds to the beauty and symmetry of the
map." - Melish
