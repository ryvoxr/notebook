# Assignment 10

## Reconstruction Act of 1867

Divided the south into military districts
- Under the control of the US
- Former Confederate states had to grant the right to vote to freedman and deny
  it to ex-Confederates

Congress would readmit a state to the Union after conditions were met 
- And they sate ratified the Fourteenth Amendment

Vetoed by Andrew Johnson but Congress overruled his veto

## Impeachment of Andrew Johnson  

Johnson dismissed the secretary of war unwarrantably
- The House of Representatives introduced the articles of impeachment

One vote short of conviction

## Fifteenth Amendment NWSA and AWSA                                                       

Fifteenth Amendment protected male citizens' right to vote irrespective of race,
color, or "previous condition of servitude"
- Had a tax and literacy requirements

Congress required that the four states under federal control ratify the
amendment as a condition for admission

AWSA -> American Woman Suffrage Association
- Loyal to the Republic Party
- Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony

NWSA -> National Woman Suffrage Association
- Focused exclusively on women's rights
- Fought for federal suffrage amendment

AWSA and NWSA are horrible names in my opinion
1. They don't actually show the difference between them
2. They stand for virtually the same thing
3. They are run by the same people

## Minor v. Happersett (1875)                              

Suffragists tried to register and vote
- Most were turned away
Supreme court ruled that suffrage rights were not inherent in citizenship
- Women were citizens, but state legislatures could deny them the right to vote
  if they wanted to
