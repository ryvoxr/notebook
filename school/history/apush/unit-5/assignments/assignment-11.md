# Assignment 11

## Describe the Republican governments in the southern states during Reconstruction.

Republican governments in Confederate states retained power for a while after
the war
- Ex-Confederates never accepted their legitimacy
- "It is strange, abnormal, and unfit that a negro Legislature should deal with
  the gravest commercial and financial interests."

They reformed public education, family law, social services, commerce, and
transportation
- Tried to import the Northern transformations into the south

The southern Republican Party included former Whigs, a few former Democrats,
black and white Northerners, and souther African Americans
- Faced the dilemma of racial prejudice
- White unionists were eager to join the party but reluctant to work with black
  allies
- Desperately needed African Americans because they were a majority in many
  states

## Who were the “scalawags and carpetbaggers”? Why do they have those names?

Scalawags -> term that ex-Confederates used to describe southern whites who
supported Reconstruction (means worthless animal)
- "Keep the change you filthy animal"

Carpetbaggers -> term that ex-Confederates used to describe northern whites
that moved down to the south, carrying all of their property in cheap suitcases
called carpetbags

## What were the achievements of the state governments during Reconstruction?

Eliminated property qualifications for the vote and abolished Black Codes

New state constitutions expanded the rights of married women
- Enabled them to own their own property and wages
- "a wonderful reform for the cause of Women's Rights"

Used government to foster economic growth
- Poured money into railroads and other projects

Brought souther state and city governments up to date
- Outlawed corporal punishments like whipping and branding
- Established hospitals and systems for orphans and the disabled

## What was the Civil Rights Act of 1875?

Required "full and equal" access to jury service and to transportation and
public accommodations, irrespective of race
- Last act for a hundred years--until the civil Rights Act of 1964

## What was the impact of the Panic of 1873 on Reconstruction?

Sudden onset of a severe worldwide depression in the United States

The initial panic was triggered by the bankruptcy of the Northern Pacific Railroad
- Raised suspicions that Republican financial manipulation had caused the depression

Directly undercut Republic policies
- The ex-Confederacy was still recovering from war, and the new economic and
  social order was fragile
- The bold policies of the Republicans cost a lot of money
- Failed to materialize because they didn't have the money (not sure what they
  thought was going to happen)

## Who was Nathan Bedford Forrest and what role did the Klan play in the counterrevolution against Reconstruction?

Was a big ex-Confederate general
- Big time slave trader and Mississippi planter
- Formed a Tennessee Confederate cavalry regiment
- Won fame as a daring raider
- Determined to uphold white supremacy

Became the Grand Wizard of the KKK
- Klan was basically the Democratic party

## What role did the Supreme Court play in limiting Reconstruction?

Court began to undercut the power of the Fourteenth Amendment
- The justices argued that the Fourteenth Amendment offered only a few federal
  protections to citizens

Ruled that voting rights remained a state matter unless the state
itself violated those rights

The Fourteenth Amendment  did not protect citizens from armed vigilantes even
when those vigilantes seized political power
