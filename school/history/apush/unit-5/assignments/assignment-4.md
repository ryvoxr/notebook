## Emergence of the Republican Party

Kansas-Nebraska Act was a thing
- Proposed by Stephen Douglas
- Created the states Kansas and Nebraska
- Extinguish native American rights on the Great plains and create a large free
  territory called Nebraska
- Explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise
    - Potentially enabling slavery to extend into the west

Abolitionists refused to join
- The Republicans compromised too much on the need for immediate abolition

Almost all Republicans wanted to limit or remove slavery
- Slavery drove down the wages of free workers and degraded the dignity of
  manual labour

Republicans praised a society based on the "middling classes who own the soil
and work it with their own hands"
- Society of independent farmers, artisans, and proprietors
- Celebrated middle-class values: domesticity and respectability, religious
  commitment, and capitalist enterprise

## Buchanan’s Failed Presidency

Buchanan kind of won only because the other parties were not unififed

Was up to Buchanan to hold together the Democratic party
- The Democratic party was the only remaining national party
- He done messed up

Did the Dred Scott decision

## The Dred Scott decision

Sought to clarify Congress's constitutional authority over slavery
- Wether or not a slave in a free state was still considered a slave

Taney and others argued that they could never be citizens of the United States
- They had no rights that white men had
    - They could not sue in court (arguing that the case was null (but not
      necessarily void...heh)

Because of the Fifth Amendment (prohibiting taking property without due process)
- Congress could not prevent southern citizens from moving slave property into the territories
- Declared the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional
- Congress could not give territorial governments the right to declare free
  until they had a constitution and were a state

## Lincoln’s background

## Election of 1860

Democrat party is split
- Northern democrats rejected the proposal to protect slavery in the territories
- Disjointed nomination
