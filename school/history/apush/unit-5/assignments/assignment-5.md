## Secession Winter

### Secession Conventions

South Carolina seceded almost immediately
- "Our enemies are about to take possession of the government"
- Unanimously decided to secede at a state convention in 1860
    - "dissolve the union now subsisting between South Carolina and the other
      states"

Other similar convections in the Deep South
- Organized mobs to attack local Union supporters
- White Mississippians enacted a secession ordinance
- Followed by Florida and Louisiana

All of the Deep South states had seceded

Secessionists were very enthusiastic
- Met in Montgomery Alabama to proclaim a new nation -> the confederate States
  of America

Secessionist fervor was less intense in the Upper South (Virginia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas)
- Legislatures s of Virginia and Tennessee refused to join the secessionist
  movement and urged a compromise

White opinion was divided in the four border slave states (Maryland, Delaware,
Kentucky, Missouri)
- Yeomen farmers held greater political power

### Lincoln

In his 1861 inaugural address, he carefully outlined his positions
- Promised to safeguard slavery where it existed but vowed to prevent its expansion
- Declared that the Union was "perpetual"
    - The secession of the southern states was illegal

Intended to "hold, occupy, and posses" federal property in the seceded sates
- "to collect duties and imposts" there
