    Very patriotic - men felt obligated to go

    With nearly two-thirds of then nations population, the North was far better
    equipped than the south to sustain the prolonged, large-scale conflict
    that the Civil War became

    The North;s Economy lent itself better to wartime needs
    &
    Call for volunteers was successful

\begin{tabular}{|p{14cm}|}

    Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two. Grant defeated two Confederate
    armies and laid siege to the city. Took port Hudson and seized control of
    he entire Mississippi River. Cut off Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas from
    the rest of the Confederacy.
    \\
    \hline
    Gettysburg: Lee did a dangerous assault against the Union front Lines. Very
    deadly battle. Meade let the Confederate units escape. Still, Gettysburg
    was a major Union victory. Marked a military and political turning point.
    \\
    \hline
    Sherman's march to the sea. Devastated Atlanta. Focused on destroying
    property. Demoralized soldiers.
    \\

\subsection{Strategy}
\begin{tabular}{|p{7cm}|p{7cm}|}
    \hline
    United States & Confederacy \\
    \hline
    Invested heavily in railroads. Had become the major carrier of wheat and
    freight from the Midwest to northeastern Atlantic posts.
    
    Enacted a program of government-assisted economic development. Imposed high
    tariffs, encouraged domestic industries, offered free land to farmers
    through the Homestead Act.

    Created an integrated network of national banks and implemented Clay's
    program for a nationally financed transportation system.
    &
    Initially left most matters to the state governments

    As the conflict became larger, they built shipyards, armories, foundries
    and textile mills.
    \\
    \hline

\subsection{How was the war funded?}
\begin{tabular}{|p{7cm}|p{7cm}|}
    \hline
    United States & Confederacy \\
    \hline
    Invested heavily in transportation and agriculture
    &
    Tried to tax the citizens. It was a confederacy so it couldn't actually
    collect the taxes. They didn't want to pay the taxes.
    \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{How did the war end?}
\begin{tabular}{|p{14cm}|}
    \hline
    Southern farmers didn't like the draft. More and more soldiers fled home
    Actual end took place in Virginia. Grant got control of the railroad at
    Petersburg. Forced Lee to abandon Richmond. Lincoln visited the
    Confederate Capital. Cut off Lee's escape to North Carolina.
    \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Why/how did the war end?}
\begin{tabular}{|p{14cm}|}
    \hline
    The Confederate soldiers were already tired of the war. Many citizens even
    promised blacks freedom. Just wanted it to be over. Sherman and hard war
    had destroyed much of their property. Lee was blocked off. The Confederacy
    didn't have a leader or loyal army.
