# Assignment 2

## The Homestead Act

Gave 160 acres of federal land to any applicant who occupied and improved the
property

Republicans hoped that it would help build up the West
- At the time, the West was inhabited by Indian people but remained "empty" on
  maps

Congress also created the Department of Agriculture
- Federal land-grant colleges

## MiningÂ 

Found gold in Nevada, the Colorado Rockies, and South Dakota
- These areas were overrun b prospectors and other people

Congress passed the General Mining Act of 1872
- Allowed those who discovered minerals on federally owned land to work the
  claim and keep all the proceeds

The rise of western mining created a market for wood and produce from the
Pacific Northwest
- Seattle and Portland grew as supply centers

## Slaughter of the bison (buffalo) and introduction of cattle

Hunters hunted them so much in the 1870's that there were only 200 at one point

The removal of the bison opened opportunities for cattle ranchers
- 5 million cattle by the end of the Civil War

Cattle boom collapsed after a drought
- Cattle ranching survived and became part of integrated national economy

## Women in the West

The success of a farm depended on the work of wives
- They tended the garden and animals, preserved food, and helped out at harvest
  time

Mormons were/are a thing

Some women ended up in legislature somehow

## Environmental challenges on the Plains

Lots of grasshoppers could destroy crops

Prairie fire or hailstorm

Tornadoes

Blizzards

Water and lumber were hard to find

"Newly arrived families often cut dugouts into hillsides."
- This is basically how the shire was formed
- A bunch of Hobbits, being Harfoots, Fallowhides, and Stoors, came to the land
  that is the Shire and dug into the side of hills
- The only people that lived in holes hundreds of years later were the very
  poor that could only afford a small dugout, and the very rich (Bilbo and co)
  that could afford a massive, true embellishment of a Hobbit hole

## Yellowstone National Park

The Northern Pacific Railroad lobbied Congress to get the park established
- Maybe because it would increase railroad traffic

Established a bunch of other national parks in the west
