# Assignment 2

## Andrew Carnegie

Andrew Carnegie exemplified American success

1. Arrived from Scotland as a poor twelve-year-old in 1848
2. Found work as an errand boy for the Pennsylvania Railroad
3. Scaled the managerial ladder
4. Struck out on his own as an iron manufacturer, selling to friends in the
   railroad business
5. Built a massive steel mill outside Pittsburgh

## Homestead Lockout

At first, skilled workers at Carnegie's mill in Homestead earned good wages
- Had strong union
- Carnegie affirmed workers' right to organize

Decided that collective bargaining was too expensive

Got his partner Henry Clay Frick to demand that the workers dissolve the union
and sign individual contracts

Resulted in a bloody riot mate

## Management revolution

Appropriated top executives responsible for day-to-day operations by function
- Purchasing, machinery, freight traffic, passenger traffic
- Established clear lines of commination

"Take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves"

Created the internal structure adopted by many large, complex corporations.

The US became an industrial power by tapping its vast natural resources,
particularly to use large amounts of coal.
- Steam engines replaced human and animal labor
- Kerosene replaced whale oil and wood

## Swift

Gustavus Swift was a shrewd Chicago cattle dealer

Saw that local slaughterhouses lacked the scale to utilize waste by-products
and cut labor costs
- To improve productivity, Swift invented the assembly line, where each wage
  worker repeated the same slaughtering task over and over

## Vertical integration

A model in which a company controlled all aspects of production from raw
materials to finished goods

## Rockefeller, Standard Oil

John D. Rockefeller was the king of petroleum

Because whaling decreased, whale-oil customers looked for alternative lighting
sources

Lots of oil wells appeared in Pennsylvania

Succeeded through vertical integration -> to control production and sales all
the way from the oil well to the kerosene

## Rebates

Discounts that were given to compensate for the boom and bust of some
industries (like oil)

## Horizontal integration

After driving competitors to the brink of failure through predatory pricing,
invite them to merge their local companies with your own. Most agreed because
they had no choice.

## Trusts Carnegie’s “Wealth”

Organized a small group of associates to hold stock from a group of combined
firms, managing them as a single entity.

## What factors led to the development of a national consumer culture? (note some examples)

Bell Telephone and Westinghouse set up research laboratories.

Steelmakers invested in chemistry and materials science to make their products
cheaper, better, and stronger.

Mass markets brought an appealing array of goods to consumers who could afford
them.

The department stores displaced small retail shops, tempting customers with
large show windows and Christmas displays.

## What new jobs emerged? – managers? Salesmen? Jobs for women?

Middle managers took on entirely new tasks, directing the flow of goods, labor,
and information throughout the enterprise.

New kind of sales force.

Secretarial work became a dead-end job, and employers began assigning it to
women.

77% of all stenographers and typists were female; by 1920, women held half of
all low-level office jobs.

## Industrialized labor and deskilling

As industrialization advanced workers lost the independence characteristic of
craft work.

This was caused by the deskilling of labor under a new system of mechanized
manufacturing.

## Scientific management

By the early twentieth century, managers sought to further reduce costs through
a program of industrial efficiency called scientific management.

Recommended that employers eliminate all brain work from manual labor, hiring
experts to develop rules for the shop floor.

Workers must be required to "do what they are told promptly and without asking
questions or making suggestions".
