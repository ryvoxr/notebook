## How did cities change during the Gilded Age?

During the Gilded age cities pioneered mass transit, centralized industry,
skyscrapers, and electricity. Specialized districts were created for finance,
manufacturing, wholesaling, and warehousing. The condensed nature of modern
cities allowed people to accomplish much more in a day than was previously
possible. New technologies light skyscrapers and electricity attracted people
to come and live in cities.

## How and why were neighborhoods divided by ethnic group? What was life like in ethnic enclaves?

Ethnic clustering occurred because immigrants relied on relatives and friends to
get oriented and find jobs. Clustering also occurred within factories; a single
ethnicity would commonly dominate a specific shop. Institutions of many kinds
were created to serve ethnic urban communities. Ethnic neighborhoods were
created because of the discrimination that immigrants faced as well as their
desire to stick together. 

## What were city living conditions like?

Working-class immigrants required cheap housing close to their jobs. As
middle-class families moved away, large tenements (apartments) were built in
their place. Tenements ran rampant with disease and were rather airless.

## How did people spend their leisure time?

The vaudeville theater was one of the first forms of mass urban amusements
where people could watch a constant stream of entertainment for free.
Nickelodeons, or movies were also available (although considered less classy).
Amusement parks and music also became very important to the urban leisure
environment.
