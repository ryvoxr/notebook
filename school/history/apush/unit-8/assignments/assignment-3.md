# Assignment 3 

## Why did Wilson seek to be neutral at the beginning of WWI?

Wilson called on Americans to "be neutral in fact as well as in name"


If the US remained out of the conflict, Wilson believed that he could influence
he postwar settlement
- Similar to what Teddy Roosevelt had done after previous conflicts

It would have been nearly impossible in 1914 to unite Americans behind the
Allies
- Immigrants viewed Britain as an enemy

## What pushed Wilson and the United States towards war?

1. Britain's massive navy
2. Big trade with Britain and France

Britain held commanding power at sea
- The British had a naval blockade to cut off vital supplies to the Central
  Powers

If Germany won and Britain and France defaulted on their debts, American
companies would suffer catastrophic losses

### U-Boats

Short for Underseeboot (submarine)

Germany issued a warning that all ships flying flags of Britain or its allies
were liable to destruction

An attack on a British boat carrying American passengers

Sussex pledge
- Germany agreed not to target passenger liners or merchant ships unless and
  inspection showed the latter carried weapons

Because of the sinking of the *Lusitania*, Wilson reconsidered his options

### Zimmerman Telegram

Urged Mexico to join the Central Powers, promising that if the US entered the
war, Germany would help Mexico recover "the lost territory of Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona"

This threat jolted public opinion

## “Doughboys”

## Flu epidemic

## War Industries Board

The War Industries Board (WIB) directed military production


Allocated scarce resources among industries, ordered factories to convert to
war production, set prices, and standardized procedures

## Fuel Administration and Herbert Hoover

Fuel Administration introduced daylight savings time to conserve coal and oil

The Food Administration, lead by Herbert Hoover
- :food will win the war"
- Convinced farmers to double their acreage of grain
- Allowed a threefold rise in food exports to Europe

## CPI and George Creel

Formed the Committee on Public Information to suppress wartime dissent

A government propaganda agency
- Educating citizens about democracy, assimilating immigrants, ending the
  isolation of rural life

Set out to mold Americans into "one white-hot mass" of war patriotism

## The Espionage Act and the Sedition Act

Sedition Act of 1918
- Prohibited any words or behavior that might :incite, provoke, or encourage
  resistance to the United States, or promote the cause of its enemies"

Espionage Act of 1917
- Defined treason loosely
- Led to the conviction of more than a thousand people

## Schenck v. United States

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a socialist who was jailed for
circulating pamphlets that urged army draftees to resist induction

## Great Migrations

More than 400,000 African Americans moved to heavy, industrial cities
