# What do banks do

- Banks keep little to none of your deposit in reserves
- Nowadays, banks are only required to hold about a month's supply of
  withdraws
- This is normally not a big deal, unless many people are trying to withdraw a
  lot of money at the same time (bank run) (Great Depression, SVB)
- During a bank run, banks are forced to sell bonds and securities at a loss
  (not good)
- Banks invest your money in government bonds, securities, or sometimes even
  the stock market
