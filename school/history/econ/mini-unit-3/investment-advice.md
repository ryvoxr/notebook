# Investment Advice

**Think about the ideas we've explored thus far in this unit. Write a brief
paragraph to your future self, highlighting at least three pieces of
investment advice.**

Start early, even if that means starting small. As your investment grows, you
earn interest on both the initial balance and any interest you earn as you go.
Compound interest grows exponentially over time, so start early. Pick
investments and risk portfolios based on your comfortability and financial
stability. Investing in a high risk high reward portfolio without a safety net
to fall back on is not a good idea; in the same vain, investing in only
low-return funds will not give you the best results.
