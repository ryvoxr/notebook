## Case Studies (for video)

### Price Gouging

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Anti-price gouging laws were implemented in various affected areas to prevent
excessive price increases for essential goods

Hotels were prohibited from significantly increasing room rates
- Establishments faced challenges in covering their increased operating costs
  due to the surge in demand for accommodations

There was a reduction in the incentive for hotels to operate during the crisis
- With prices capped, hotels found it financially unsustainable to provide
  lodging, especially because of the increased costs due to emergency
  preparations and potential property damage

Hotels closed their doors or reduced their services
- Created a even bigger shortage of available accommodations for displaced
  individuals

### Affordable Housing

"Affordable Housing"
- Require developers to rent out a percentage of the new units they build at
  discounted rates to low-income tenants
- Adopted by 886 jurisdictions nationwide
- Hope is these mandates will improve affordability and equity without costing
  taxpayer money

Inclusionary zoning encourages developers to build more profitable but
harder-to-lease luxury buildings
- Higher rents used to recoup the costs of the cheaper units they're forced to
  build
- Counties require between 5 and 20 percent of housing to be affordable

Inclusionary zoning acts as a tax on development
- Do a poor job of creating affordable units
- New York City's inclusionary zoning program only led to the creation of 172
  units in the first 25 years

### Sesame Seeds

[https://reason.com/2023/07/28/fda-commissioner-no-one-envisioned-the-consequences-of-new-sesame-seed-labeling-rule/](https://reason.com/2023/07/28/fda-commissioner-no-one-envisioned-the-consequences-of-new-sesame-seed-labeling-rule/)

The Food and Drug Administration mandated warning labels for products
containing sesame seeds
- The result: suddenly everything contained sesame seeds

Attempted to help those with sesame seed allergies
- Added the ingredient to the list of items that have to be declared in food
  (eggs, milk, shellfish, etc)
- In response, food manufacturers added sesame seeds to products that
  previously contained none

The food producers were doing what made economic sense
- The fines for not disclosing seeds were huge
- It's much cheaper to add a few sesame seeds in rather than risk paying big
  fines

Now fewer sesame-seed-free products are available to those with the allergy

[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/update-sesame-allergen-labeling-food-packages](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/update-sesame-allergen-labeling-food-packages)

"I donâ€™t think anyone envisioned there being a decrease in the availability of
products that are safe choices for sesame allergic consumers."
- Except, perhaps, the many food processing facilities that responded to the
  FDA's new policy by doing exactly this
- What he means is that nobody within the FDA could have predicted this outcome

### Empty Covid Planes

[https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/heres-why-so-many-planes-are-still-flying-nearly-empty.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/heres-why-so-many-planes-are-still-flying-nearly-empty.html)]

The CARES Act gives airlines money
- In order to receive the money, the airlines must continue serving nearly
  everywhere they were before

The intent: some travel is necessary and it's important for people to be able
to get places by air

The unintended consequence: airlines are now incentivized to fly planes in
order to still qualify for federal aid
- Huge environmental impact
- No economic stimulus

[https://simpleflying.com/airport-slots/](https://simpleflying.com/airport-slots/)

Airports use a slotting system to determine who gets to takeoff and land
- Regulatory commissions are in charge of the rules related to slotting
- Slots are managed worldwide by the International Air Transport Association
- Locally in the US, its the Federal Aviation Administration

At the start of the pandemic, most countries had a "use them or lose them" rule
- If a slot has not been utilized 80% of the time one year, it must be given up
  by the airline
- This provides a strong incentive for airlines to fly planes, regardless of
  how full they are
- Losing a slot is disastrous

### CAFE Standards

[https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards)

First enacted in 1975
- Intended to reduce energy consumption by increasing the fuel economy of cars
  and light trucks

CAFE standards are fleet-wide averages that must be met by automakers

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards
- Require manufacturers to meet minimum fuel requirements for their vehicles

[https://reason.org/policy-brief/the-effect-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-standards-on-consumers/](https://reason.org/policy-brief/the-effect-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-standards-on-consumers/)

Penalize automakers who fail to meet efficiency standards
- Categorized by vehicle size; more stringent targets for passenger cars than
  for trucks
- Instead of hitting the more difficult standards for cars, car manufacturers
  switched to producing larger, fuel-guzzling SUV's that classify as trucks in
  order to more easily meet the standard
- Now, 80% of all new vehicles sold are considered "light trucks"

### Window Tax

Property tax based on the number of windows in a house
- Introduced in 1696
- Designed to impose a tax relative to the prosperity of the taxpayer before
  the income tax was a thing

The tax:
- Flat-rate house tax of two shillings
- Variable tax for houses with more than ten windows
- 10-20 payed four shillings
- more than 20 payed 8 shillings
- Seen as a tax on "light and air"

Adam Smith was like: you can count the windows from the outside
- Got the thumbs up from Adam Smith

The result:
- Although wealthier people tend to have more windows, the poorest people in
  England lived in tenements with lots of windows
- Tenement landlords, to avoid the tax, bricked up windows in their buildings
- This drastically reduced the quality, safety, and health of tenements

Dickens was pissed

### Billboards

[https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/UnintendedConsequences.html](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/UnintendedConsequences.html)

In 1968, Vermont outlawed roadside billboards and large signs in order to
protect the state's pastoral vistas
- Instead of billboards, large, bizarre "sculptures" started to appear next to
  businesses
- A car dealership built a 12 foot sixteen ton gorilla clutching a real
  Volkswagen Beetle
- A carpet store had a nineteen-foot genie holding aloft a rolled carpet as he
  emerges from a smoking teapot
- There was also a horse, a rooster, and a squirrel in red suspenders

### Prohibition

Nationwide ban on the production and sale of alcohol in the United States
- Cam eon the heels of a similar ban in Russia

Temperance
- Believed that alcohol was the fundamental reason behind problems like
  poverty and domestic violence
- Tried to convince governments of this
- Wanted alcohol to be banned entirely

Maine and several other states banned to sale and production of liquor in the 1850s

In 1919, the 18th amendment banned the manufacture, sale, and transfer of all
alcoholic beverages
- Rich people stockpiled beer and liquor because it only prevented the sale,
  manufacturing, and transfer of it not the consumption
- Breweries and distilleries tried to sell all of their alcohol

Organized crime groups established a lucrative black market in producing,
smuggling, and selling illicit liquor
- Worked side by side with corrupt policemen and government officials
- Illegal bars, known as speakeasies began serving alcohol
- People tried to make it at home for their own consumption
- People obtained it legally with a doctor's prescription or for religious
  purposes
- Government required industrial manufactures to add methanol and poison the
  alcohol they produced

### Law of Unintended Consequences

[https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/UnintendedConsequences.html](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/UnintendedConsequences.html)

The actions of people and government always have effects that are unanticipated
or unintended

Adam Smith
- "invisible hand"
- Each individual, seeking only his own gain, "is led by an invisible hand to
  promote an end which was no part of his intention"
- "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, or the baker, that we expect
  our dinner, but from regard to their own self interest."

Unanticipated effects of legislation and regulation

John Locke urged the removal of a parliamentary bill designed to cut the
maximum permissible rate of interest from 6% to 4%
- Instead of benefiting borrowers, as intended, it would hurt them

Sources of unanticipated consequences
1. Ignorance
2. Error
3. "imperious immediacy of interest" (willful ignorance)

Law of unintended consequences provides the basis for criticisms of government
programs
- Unintended consequences can add so much to the costs of some programs that
  they make the programs a bad decision
