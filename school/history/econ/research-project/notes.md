"Affordable Housing"
- Require developers to rent out a percentage of the new units they build at
  discounted rates to low-income tenants
- Adopted by 886 jurisdictions nationwide
- Hope is these mandates will improve affordability and equity without costing
  taxpayer money

Inclusionary zoing encourages developers to build more profitable but
harder-to-lease luxury buildings
- Higher rents used to recoup the costs of the cheaper units they're forced to
  build
- Counties require between 5 and 20 percent of housing to be affordable

Inclusionary zoning acts as a tax on development
- Do a poor job of creating affordable units
- New York City's inclusionary zoning program only led to the creation of 172
  units in the first 25 years
