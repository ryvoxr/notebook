### Affordable Housing

"Affordable Housing"
- Require developers to rent out a percentage of the new units they build at
  discounted rates to low-income tenants
- Adopted by 886 jurisdictions nationwide
- Hope is these mandates will improve affordability and equity without costing
  taxpayer money

Inclusionary zoning encourages developers to build more profitable but
harder-to-lease luxury buildings
- Higher rents used to recoup the costs of the cheaper units they're forced to
  build
- Counties require between 5 and 20 percent of housing to be affordable

Inclusionary zoning acts as a tax on development
- Do a poor job of creating affordable units
- New York City's inclusionary zoning program only led to the creation of 172
  units in the first 25 years

### Sesame Seeds

[https://reason.com/2023/07/28/fda-commissioner-no-one-envisioned-the-consequences-of-new-sesame-seed-labeling-rule/](https://reason.com/2023/07/28/fda-commissioner-no-one-envisioned-the-consequences-of-new-sesame-seed-labeling-rule/)

The Food and Drug Administration mandated warning labels for products
containing sesame seeds
- The result: suddenly everything contained sesame seeds

Attempted to help those with sesame seed allergies
- Added the ingredient to the list of items that have to be declared in food
  (eggs, milk, shellfish, etc)
- In response, food manufacturers added sesame seeds to products that
  previously contained none

The food producers were doing what made economic sense
- The fines for not disclosing seeds were huge
- It's much cheaper to add a few sesame seeds in rather than risk paying big
  fines

Now fewer sesame-seed-free products are available to those with the allergy

[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/update-sesame-allergen-labeling-food-packages](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/update-sesame-allergen-labeling-food-packages)

"I donâ€™t think anyone envisioned there being a decrease in the availability of
products that are safe choices for sesame allergic consumers."
- Except, perhaps, the many food processing facilities that responded to the
  FDA's new policy by doing exactly this
- What he means is that nobody within the FDA could have predicted this outcome

### Empty Covid Planes

[https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/heres-why-so-many-planes-are-still-flying-nearly-empty.html]

The CARES Act gives airlines money
- In order to receive the money, the airlines must continue serving nearly
  everywhere they were before

The intent: some travel is necessary and it's important for people to be able
to get places by air

The unintended consequence: airlines are now incentivized to fly planes in
order to still qualify for federal aid
- Huge environmental impact
- No economic stimulus

[https://simpleflying.com/airport-slots/](https://simpleflying.com/airport-slots/)

Airports use a slotting system to determine who gets to takeoff and land
- Regulatory commissions are in charge of the rules related to slotting
- Slots are managed worldwide by the International Air Transport Association
- Locally in the US, its the Federal Aviation Administration

At the start of the pandemic, most countries had a "use them or lose them" rule
- If a slot has not been utilized 80% of the time one year, it must be given up
  by the airline
- This provides a strong incentive for airlines to fly planes, regardless of
  how full they are
- Losing a slot is disastrous

### CAFE Standards

[https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards)

First enacted in 1975
- Intended to reduce energy consumption by increasing the fuel economy of cars
  and light trucks

CAFE standards are fleet-wide averages that must be met by automakers

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards
- Require manufacturers to meet minimum fuel requirements for their vehicles

[https://reason.org/policy-brief/the-effect-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-standards-on-consumers/](https://reason.org/policy-brief/the-effect-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-standards-on-consumers/)

Penalize automakers who fail to meet efficiency standards
- Categorized by vehicle size; more stringent targets for passenger cars than
  for trucks
- Instead of hitting the more difficult standards for cars, car manufacturers
  switched to producing larger, fuel-guzzling SUV's that classify as trucks in
  order to more easily meet the standard
- Now, 80% of all new vehicles sold are considered "light trucks"

### Window Tax

Property tax based on the number of windows in a house
- Introduced in 1696
- Designed to impose a tax relative to the prosperity of the taxpayer before
  the income tax was a thing

The tax:
- Flat-rate house tax of two shillings
- Variable tax for houses with more than ten windows
- 10-20 payed four shillings
- more than 20 payed 8 shillings
- Seen as a tax on "light and air"

Adam Smith was like: you can count the windows from the outside
- Got the thumbs up from Adam Smith

The result:
- Although wealthier people tend to have more windows, the poorest people in
  England lived in tenements with lots of windows
- Tenement landlords, to avoid the tax, bricked up windows in their buildings
- This drastically reduced the quality, safety, and health of tenements

Dickens was pissed
