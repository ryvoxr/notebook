### Case one: Sesame Seed Shenanigans

```
Year: 2021
Location: The United States of America
```

The problem: People are allergic to sesame seeds and need to know what products
contain them

The solution: Add sesame seeds to the Food and Drug Administration's list of
items that are required to be declared in food. Then, slam companies who don't
follow the rules with massive fines.

```People cheering with Milton Friedman shaking his head with that one quote```

It turns out companies don't like to pay fines. Instead of spending millions of
dollars in order to test their products for sesame seeds, companies simply
sprinkled in a few sesame seeds to products that previously contained none and
then marked "contains sesame seeds" on the box. Over the next few months, the
number of sesame-seed-free products plummeted.

"I don't think anyone envisioned there being a decrease in the availability of
products that are safe choices for sesame allergic consumers" said the FDA
head. Except perhaps the many food companies that responded to the FDA's new
policy by doing exactly this. What he means, of course, is that nobody within
the FDA could have predicted this outcome.

### Case two: Covid Ghost Planes

```
Year: 2020
Location: Most developed nations
```

Airports use a slotting system to determine how many flights airlines are
allowed to fly.

The problem: There are not enough slots in major airports and some airlines are
holding slots they don't need to prevent other airlines from competing with
them.

The solution: Enact a "use them or lose them" policy that requires airlines to
utilize their slots at 80% capacity. If airlines don't, the FAA will require
them to relinquish their slots (most likely to their direct competitors).

It turns out, airlines don't like losing their slots. During Covid, air travel
was at an all time low. Despite this, airlines still flew at the required 80%
capacity in order to keep their slots. This resulted in countless "ghost
flights" where planes would take off, fly, and land at their destination
carrying few or zero passengers.

### Case three: The CAFE Standards Oopsie

```
Year: 1975
Location: The United States of America
```
The problem: cars are using too much fossil fuels and the resulting carbon emissions
are probably killing the planet

The solution: Enact fleet-wide energy consumption average requirements called
the CAFE Standards.

```
Have newspapers with these titles:
Can't Anyone Find ET?
Cancun Ain't For Eating
Carnivorous Aliens Fund Easter???
Corporate Average Fuel Economy
```

These standards award fines to manufacturers who fail to meet the efficiency
requirements. The standards are categorized by vehicle size with stricter
requirements for cars than for trucks.  

```People cheering with Milton Friedman shaking his head with that one quote```

It turns out, manufacturers don't like paying fines. 

Instead of designing and manufacturing more expensive and fuel efficient cars,
manufacturers simply switched to producing larger fuel-guzzling SUV's that meet
the legal definition for a "light truck".

### Case four: Prohibition

```
Year: 1919
Location: The United States of America
```

The problem: alcohol is ruining the moral fiber of America and is the
fundamental reason behind problems like poverty and domestic violence.

The solution: pass the 18th Amendment to the Constitution banning the
manufacture, sale, and transfer of all alcoholic beverages.

```People cheering with Milton Friedman shaking his head with that one quote```

It turns out, everybody still wanted alcohol. Instead of rolling over and
staying sober, Americans found new ways to get booze.

Organized crime groups established a lucrative black market in producing,
smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. These crime groups worked side-by-side
with corrupt policemen and government officials. Thousands of illegal bars,
known as speakeasies began serving alcohol.

Some people tried to make it it at home for their own consumption. This had the
disastrous consequence of poorly made, home-brewed alcohol that contained the
poison methanol. Thousands of Americans died during prohibition from methanol
poisoning alone.
