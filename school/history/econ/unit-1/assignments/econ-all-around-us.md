Insights:
- The article duly noted that the United States has a centrally planned economy
- It seems that the Federal Reserve has complete control over inflation based
  on where they set interest rates
- Raising interest rates can have negative effects, but lowering interest rates
  requires rates to be raised later due to inflation
Question:
- Will the US experience a recession in the coming 12 months?
- Will the Fed decide to raise interest rates again?
