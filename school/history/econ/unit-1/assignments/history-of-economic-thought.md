# Assignment 1

## In 2-3 sentences, summarize a few of the key features of each thinker's economic ideas

Adam Smith
- He was a supporter of laissez-faire economic policies
- Believed in spontaneous order (the tendency of free markets to regulate
  themselves using competition, supply and demand, and self interest)
    - The article calls this the "Invisible Hand"

Karl Marx
- Literally created communism. Used his criticisms of capitalism to justify his
  proposed solution of communism
- Exploitation and Surplus Value
    - Surplus Value is just profit
    - He argues that surplus value is evil because it means that laborers (the
      "proletariat") are being paid less than the value of their work
    - Basically anti-profit

## Identify at least two differences between the economists' positions or ideas

Smith believed in a hands-off laissez-faire economic policy where profits and
losses exist while Marx declared that all "Surplus Value" (profit) was evil and
exploitative of laborers.

Marx believed in the Labor Theory of Value to determine prices while Smith most
likely believed in prices being determined by the value of the alternative uses
of the materials required (opportunity cost).

## Why do you think the ideas of these economists remain so influential today

Adam Smith and Karl Marx more or less founded their economic schools, classical
(Smithian) and Marxist respectively
