# Incentives in the News

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/us/politics/biden-foreign-investment-factories.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/us/politics/biden-foreign-investment-factories.html.md)

### Summary of the story and the way incentives fit into it

This article talks about this shift of foreign investment in the United States
due to tax breaks and other incentives for advanced manufacturing the President
Biden signed into law. The article continues by saying that although the
hundereds of billions of taxpayer dollars directed towards manufacturing have
not increased the overal amount of foreign investment, it has shifted that
investment to manufacturing. In this story, governmental monetary incentives
are seeming enticing foreign investors to shift their investments to the
incentivised sector.

### Why this drew you in (or, why you find it important)

This article drew me in because it was a very recent article (August 23rd),
it mentioned Incentives in the name, and it presented a minor challege of
bypassing the NY Times paywall.
