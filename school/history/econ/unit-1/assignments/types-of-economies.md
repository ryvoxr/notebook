# Types of Economies

## In 2-3 sentences each, explain how each different type of economy allocates resources

Traditional:
- Allocate resources based off of kinship, custom, and religion. Goods are
  produced in order to meet the direct needs of the population. Innovation is
  far slower because there is no motivation for individuals to research,
  invent, or innovate.

Command:
- Resources are allocated by a select few central planners in the government.
  Central planners must be experts in all fields, determining what people
  genuinely need and want. Production quantity, quality, and motivation is very
  low because there is no competition or other motivating factor for laborers.

Market:
- In a market economy resources are allocated by demand created by people.
  Allocation of scarce resources will shift to wherever demand is highest and
  thus profit is greatest. This incentivizes selling things people want and
  disincentives selling things people don't want.

Mixed:
- Mixed economic systems allocate resources by taking profits from corporations
  of the underlying market economy and redistributing them to less successful
  individuals, or to individuals who meet some set standard, in the form of tax
  breaks and subsidies.

## In a brief paragraph, speculate on how living under each different type of economy might impact those living in that society

Living in an economy where individual economic liberty is placed higher than
the common good, such as a market economy, allows for greater individual
achievement but results in economic inequity for others. On the other hand,
living in a more state-controlled economic system results in everyone's economic
futures being very similar and thus lower or higher than they would have been
without state-intervention.
