# Incentives and RCHS

**Consider a challenge that student clubs and faculty committees have been
discussing for over two decades: How do we encourage environmentally-friendly
habits and behaviors among our school community? These behaviors might include
recycling, composting, helping clean common spaces–just to name a few. Try to
apply the knowledge you’ve gained about the role and function of incentives in
the economy, and create a “five-point plan” to address this topic. Your plan
can involve any aspect of environmental or school stewardship. Be sure to
consider all the different possible types of incentives–and their advantages
and disadvantages.**

Point one: Charge an extra 25c for canned drinks and offer a 25c refund for
returned canned drinks.

Point two: Assign students with detention work that helps the environment:
picking up litter etc.

Point three: Allow students who wish to buy lunch sign up at the beginning of
each sixth to buy food each week. Offer a discounted price for early-signups;
lost profit can be made up by proportionally raising on-day food sales. Knowing
the number of students who wish to buy lunch will help reduce food waste and
prevent students from going without lunch.

Point four: Make recycling duty opt-in. Students who volunteer each sixth will
receive a free lunch. Voluntary paid workers will often do a better and more
efficient job that unpaid forced labor.

Point five: Have economics teachers assign their students to generate a list of
incentives for helping the school stay environmentally friendly. Take away their
homework points if they don't complete the assignment.
