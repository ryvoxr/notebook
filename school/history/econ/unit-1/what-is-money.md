# What is Money 

## What, in your view, is the most important function of money

In my view, the most important function of money is its ability to be an
abstraction for value. This abstraction allows for clear representation of
value based off of a shared standard. Without a clear representation of value,
it is difficult for individuals to agree on the clear value of an object and
thus makes it more difficult to barter, trade, or sell.

## What, in your view, is the most important characteristic of money

The most important characteristic of money is that it either has intrisic
value, represents a physical object that has intrinsic value, or has gained the
faith of enough people to be exchanged for things with intrinsic value. If
people lose faith in the underlying system of a fiat currency (i.e. The Federal
Reserve System) then its value falls immediately to zero. Without either a
physical backing or widespread faith in the underlying mechanics, no currency
can last.
