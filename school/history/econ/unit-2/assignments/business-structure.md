### What is a corporation?

A corporation is a distinct entity of the law set up by individuals to conduct
business and produce goods and services. Corporations are owned by
shareholders. In the face of the law, corporations are treated separately from
their owners.

### What is a shareholder?

A shareholder is someone who owns a share, or portion, of a company.
Shareholders get one vote for each share they own on major business decisions.
They benefit from the value of their share going up as well as receiving
dividends from the corporation

### Explain the concept of limited liability.

Limited liability is an aspect of corporations that prevents shareholders from
being personally responsible for the actions and damages of the corporation.
Limited liability only protects the personal assets of the shareholders, not
the corporation's own assets. The money and property owned by the corporation
itself is still available to address any harm or liabilities the company
causes.

### Who controls a corporation?

If an entity owns more than 50 percent of a corporations outstanding shares, it
controls the company. With 50 percent of the shares, an entity can win every
vote and do whatever they want to with the company.
