# Costs of Production

### How do businesses determine profit?

To determine profit businesses must know their total revenue and their total costs. 
- Revenue -> income the business receives from selling their goods or services
- Costs -> money that you spend to produce your good or service

There is no such thing as "the" cost of producing a given product or service
- The cost of producing a product is very different at the scale of which you
  produce it
- Large fixed costs are among the reasons for lower costs of production per
  unit of output as the amount of output increases
- Economies of scale
- Diseconomies of scale


### What is the difference between fixed and variable costs?

Variable costs vary based on the quantity of which you sell and fixed costs do
not
- Large fixed costs can reduce the cost per unit (like buying big expensive
  machinery)

### What is accounting profit?

Accounting profit is the magnitude by which the businesses revenue exceeds its
costs
- Even if revenue decreases, variable costs may decrease with them creating a
  zero-sum change

  price
