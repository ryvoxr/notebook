Creating regulations through corrupt government in order to form an artificial
monopoly
- Government banning competition of certain corporations that are favorable to
  corrupt government
- Anti-free market
- Licences

### What are some barriers to entry that limit competition in markets?

1. Licences
2. Government regulation
3. High startup costs

### What are antitrust laws? (review from US History!)

Promote competition and outlaw anti-competitive tactics
- Monopolies used to be called trusts

Gives the federal government and the FTC greater authority to prevent
monopolies

A little ironic because most monopolies are formed through a corrupt government
creating laws and regulations to artificially beat competitors. And this is a
regulator law.

- Public utilities
- Electricity, water, natural gas, and sewage

### What is price discrimination and what historical examples do they give in the Crash Course?

Monopolies can charge more for their products

Charging different consumers different prices for the same product
