### Notes

Opportunity cost -> the value of the alternate decision, or the alternate uses
of resources

"There are no solutions only trade-offs" - Thomas Sowell (super cool guy)

- By definition never seen because it is what doesn't happen
- Can be overlooked because it is never seen

Money is worth more the longer it is kept
- Can be invested and grow
- Is bad to be stagnant though because it can lose value
- This is a massive oversimplification
