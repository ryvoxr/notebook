# Inflation

### Keynesian

Demand-pull inflation:
- Increase in aggregate demand caused by an increase in public and private spending
- Encourages economic growth

Cost-push inflation:
- Supply-shock inflation
- Change in prices due to a drop in aggregate supply

Built-in inflation:
- Laborers demanding higher wages in order to keep up with inflation
- Firms raising prices due to raising costs, "passing on"

### Monetary

Most significant factor by far is the change in the money supply (M2)
- Larger M2 means each dollar is worth less
- Low interest rates are the culprit
- "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena"

Velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy
- Real value of output is determined by productive capacity

Austrian variant:
- Increase in the quantity of money that is not offset by an increase in the need
    for money

### Measures

Consumer price index (CPI):
- Weighted average of a market basket of goods
- Inflation is the increase in the price of the market basket

Interest rate:
- Interest rate related inversely with inflation
- Low interest rate -> high inflation
- High interest rate -> low inflation

Personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI):
- Indicator of the average increase of prices for all domestic personal
  consumption
- Differently weighted than the CPI

Sector specific indicators:
- Producer price index (PPI)
- Employment cost index (ECI)
