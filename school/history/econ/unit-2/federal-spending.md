# Federal Spending

1. Interest on Debt
2. National (not international) defense
3. Benefits for veterans

In my opinion, Federal spending beyond what is listed above is superfluous and
the problems addressed by the allocated money are better addressed by other
means. It is impossible to talk about spending without first talking about
monetary policy. Loose monetary policy fueling deficit spending creates a tax
not voted on: inflation. Inflation disproportionately affects lower income
individuals because it increases the price of *all*, goods therefore increasing
the cost of living. If the Federal Reserve System stemmed the flow of new
currency, much of the financial aid provided to lower income families would be
unneeded because the spending power of the money those families have would be
far greater. Similarly Federal spending on healthcare addresses the symptom not
the problem. Regulations requiring healthcare plans to include numerous
benefits increases the price of healthcare for everyone, disproportionately so
for low income individuals who may only be able to afford a limited plan. Also,
international intervention spending is bad.
