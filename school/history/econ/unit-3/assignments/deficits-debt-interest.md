# Deficits, Debt, Interest

Deficits and Surpluses are defined as the difference between revenue and spending
- 1.4 trillion deficit in 2022

Wealth or Debt is defined as the difference between liabilities and assets
- US Government currently has 33.5 trillion dollars of debt
- Public debt -> 24.2 trillion
- Federal reserve -> peaked at 6.2 trillion in Q2 2022

Interest is money paid to maintain debt
- Bonds are issued with an interest rate and bondholders collect every year

Debt ceiling
- Limit for national debt
- Once the debt limit is reached the government must raise the debt limit,
  suspend the debt limit, violate the debt limit, or default
- The US has suspended the surpassed debt ceiling of 31.4 trillion till 2025

I would like to note the stunning lack of mention of the Federal Reserve's
involvement with national debt. The article refers indirectly to the Federal
Reserve when talking about Gross debt, referring to it as "other federal
government accounts" when it is actually the **largest** federal government
account. It proceeds to list off "trust funds" with the largest balances (which
is technically correct because the Fed is not a trust fund).

Here would be my addition to the reading: When interest rates are already low
but the Fed wants to "stimulate the economy" further, the Federal Reserve
engages in Quantitative Easing. Quantitative Easing involves the Federal
Reserve purchasing Treasury bonds with money that doesn't exist thus financing
the debt and adding to the M2 supply. This practice was widely used to fund
government stimulus during COVID.
