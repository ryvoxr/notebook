# Fiscal and Monetary Policy

### What is the fundamental difference between fiscal and monetary policy?

Fiscal policy
- Implemented by Congress and the administration
- Slow reacting
- Political
- Taxes and spending

Monetary policy
- Conducted by the Federal Reserve System
- Supposedly non-political
- Controls M2
- Faster reacting than fiscal policy

### How were each of them implemented during the Great Recession?

Fiscal policy
- Economic Stimulus Act
- Housing and Economic Recovery Act
- Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
- Pumped a trillion dollars into the economy to "stimulate spending from business and consumers"

Monetary policy
- Purchased massive amounts of US Treasury Bonds and mortgage-backed securities

### According to the author, how dotes the Fed's independence reinforce the distinction between fiscal and monetary policy?

Fiscal policy is inherently political and slow while Monetary policy is
"shielded from short-term political pressures."

### Quantitative Easing in the film that we watched

In the film that we watched the other day, it was stated that quantitative
easing was something new and innovative that had never been tried before. This
was confusing to me because the only difference between QE and normal monetary
policy is the type of security and the scale. The Fed has been printing money
by buying securities for the last 70 years. River (more of a Keynes supporter)
agreed that this stress on QE as innovative was out of place and probably
factually incorrect.
