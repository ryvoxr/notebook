# National Debt

Government spending
- Increasing the deficit slightly makes a vast sum of money available to the government

The amount of Debt
- We have had debt for a really long time

The reason for the Debt
- Debt is used as credit
- Debt is used to finance useful government spending

Who Profits from the Debt?
- 68% of interest payments on the debt goes to US citizens

Interest on the National Debt
- Only 8% goes to foreign investors
- Interest payments spread out per citizen are ~ $1,600

Yaruss's arguments are not satisfying. He minimizes the scale of the National
Debt by showing that each citizen *only* has to make a $1500 payment every year
to finance the debt's interest. Looking at this fact from the other side, if
the government had no interest payments, every citizen would be $1500 richer
than they would now. In the context of current events, it is clear that the
National Debt has a far greater impact: a government shutdown due spending,
deficits, and the debt was narrowly avoided a few days ago.

Yaruss also fails to mention the extraordinary 20% of the national debt that is
owned by the Federal Reserve system. While his argument revolves mostly around
public debt, government owned debt is as much, if not more, important. The
Federal Reserve System engages in quantitative easing: buying up government
bonds (with money that doesn't exist) in order to finance the debt and
influence the economy. Bonds purchased by the Fed are paid with created money,
increasing the M2 supply and thus leading to inflation. In fact, the
inflationary results of quantitative easing are cited as beneficial to lift the
economy out of a recession. While inflation may temporarily stimulate the
economy, the long-term effects of quantitative easing are arguably far more
disastrous. Even more so due to the fact that inflationary monetary policy
feeds false booms that lead to large busts (which in turn prompts the Fed to
engage in more inflationary policy).

As I note repeatedly, it is impossible to consider tax policy and spending
policy without also considering monetary policy; the three are undeniably
intertwined.
