# Questions

### Single Payer Healthcare

Market healthcare prioritizes patients by requiring payment. Single payer
healthcare will remove the automatic filtering of non-urgent medial issues. How
does your plan prioritize patients?

There is no such thing as a free lunch. How does your plan propose to fund the
healthcare of over 300 million Americans?

### Increasing the Minimum Wage

Critics of a high minimum wage argue that it will reduce total unemployment.
This has proven to be true to some extent. How does your plan combat
unemployment?

### Universal Basic Income

Critics of universal basic income argue that it will further incentivise
non-productive behavior. They believe that with UBI, more fully capable people
will simply not support themselves because they have the government to fall
back on. How does your plan prevent this?

specifics in the tax policy and helped justify our choices.
