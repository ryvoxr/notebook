## Complexity of the Tax Code

Title 26 of The US Code, the Internal Revenue Code
- Is 2,412,000 words
- Very difficult for people to understand
- Another 7,655,000 words of tax regulations

## Tax Misconceptions

Progressive tax of the 50's
- The highest marginal tax rate was 90% in 1954
- Nobody actually payed close to those rates
- Didn't bring in that much more money
- High rates discouraged work
- President Kennedy backed a bill that lowered the top rate to 70%
- Average was 41% during this time
- There are a ton of exemptions, rebates, and carveouts that are intentionally
  baked into the system
    - Could basically write off anything
    - Instead of inventing new things, rich people hired accountants so they
      had to pay less taxes
    - The wealthy can afford the best accountants

Revenue from higher taxes:
- After decreasing the rate to 38.5% is 1986 the amount of revenue as a % of
  GDP did not change
- Since WW2 the amount of tax revenue as a % of GDP is nearly flat

- Rich people will evade taxes
    - They'll change where they earn their income, how they earn their income,
      how much they earn, when they receive income
    - Rich people may move away

### The Great American Ripoff

Income taxes make up less than half of our tax burden

Taxes:
- Income Tax, Payroll Tax, Car Registration, Corporate Tax, Entertainment Tax,
  Gift Tax, Gambling Tax, Admissions Tax, Property Taxes, Utility Taxes,
  Garbage Taxes, Alternative Minimum Tax, Federal Unemployment Taxes, Gas Tax,
  Universal Service Phone Tax, Meal Taxes, Weapons Tax, Plane Ticket Tax,
  Estate Tax, Blueberry Tax, Mahogany Quahog Clams Tax, Food-Related Items Tax,
  Marshmallow & Candy Tax, Salt Tax, Pumpkins "as decorations" Tax, Fast Food
  Tax, Candy or Prepared Food Tax, State Gross Receipts Tax, State Excise Tax,
  Sugary Drink Tax

## Policy Proposition

Simplify and rework the income tax
- Flat tax of 20% on everyone who individually makes more than 30k
- Remove literally everything else

### Exemptions

Because of the complexity of the income tax code, only the rich are able to
take full advantage of it
- Rich people spend money to hire accountants to minimize their effective tax burden
- This is only possible due to the complexity
- With a brutally simple code, there is absolutely no way to find loopholes

Removing exemptions also allows for markets to act upon real incentives
- By providing individuals with tax incentive for certain products, the Federal
  government is subjecting the US economy to a host of perverse incentives and
  unintended consequences

Removing exemptions will increase the amount of revenue generated
- Although the reduction of exemptions is accompanied by a decrease in the tax
  rate, it is likely that the elimination of deductions and exemptions will
  outweighs the decrease in required payments

### Lower Rate

The lower rate of 20% will allow incentives for production, risk, and
innovation to equilibrate to the market standard
- "People don't work to pay taxes"
- Will likely increase economic activity

Decreasing the tax rate will allow for more discretionary spending by Americans
- This will naturally increase aggregate demand stimulating the economy in a
  more sustainable way than inflationary policy
