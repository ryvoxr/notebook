# Absolute & Comparative Advantage

### David Ricardo

Lived in England when mercantilism was a thing
- Governments introduced policies to increase exports and decrease imports
- Didn't think the corn laws were cool

Ricardo extended Smith's argument to examine whether countries would benefit
from specializing and trading when one party had an absolute advantage in both
goods

Spearheaded the idea of comparative advantage
- Having a lower opportunity cost to make a product than another producer
- With two producers producing two goods at different efficiencies, one will
  always have a comparative advantage in one of the goods
- Impossible to have the comparative advantage in both goods

### Eli Heckscher & Bertil Olin

Argued that comparative advantage comes from countries' relative abundance of
capital and labor
- Capital-rich countries will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive
  products such as machines
- Labor-rich countries will have a comparative advantage in labor-intensive
  products such as farming goods
- The result is that countries tend to export goods that use their abundant
  factor of production

### Protectionism

Some people think that it is a good idea to implement tariffs and other foreign
policy in order to protect domestic business
- This is not a good idea because the hurt that domestic businesses suffer from
  cheap imports is far less than the hurt suffered by people having to pay
  higher prices for worse products

### Positions contemporary economists take on trade

Most contemporary economists support the basic Ricardian position on trade
- The believe that it helped today's industrialized countries
