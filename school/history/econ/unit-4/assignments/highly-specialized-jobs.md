Back end distributed systems engineer. A distributed systems engineer develops,
debugs, and maintains a collection of vital computer systems and software for a
product or company.

Median pay is $231,250. This is reasonable.

Nope. Makes complete sense. Things need to work and these people make them work.

Yes. Based job. Lots of money, fun, and cool.

### How does this highly specialized job relate to the idea of "preference differences"?

I couldn't find anything about "preference differences". I think that the pay

may prefer not to work for it...
