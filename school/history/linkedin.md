# Linkedin

**Of the tips provided in the article, identify two that would be areas of
strength for you and two that would be opportunities for improvement. For both,
explain why.**

*I'm not totally grasping what a strength or opportunity for improvement is.
The article was primarily tips to improve my LinkedIn profile; I don't have a
LinkedIn profile. I'll try to answer the question as best I can.*

### Strengths

Skills and Endorsements
- I've done projects for the school, teachers, and am on Varsity Scioly. These
  experiences demonstrate skills and provide references for endorsements.
Availability
- I'm not currently working

### Areas for Improvement

Don't have a profile
- I don't have a LinkedIn profile. A good first step would probably be to
  create one and fill it out with skills, experiences, and a picture.
Don't have a network
- While I have a few teachers and friends that I could connect with, I don't
  have a network of professionals. I could start by connecting with teachers
  and friends, and then expand to professionals in fields I'm interested in.
