# Project Proposal

1. Explain your chosen topic as clearly as possible with emphasis on its connection to economics
2. Tell me why you were drawn to this topic, and why do you think it is important
3. Indicate which product you're leaning towards and why

For my research project, I plan to explore both the topic of and examples of
unintended consequences. Unintended consequences in relation to economics and
policy are the results of a policy decision that are outside of the intended
effect of that policy. The history of thought about unintended consequences
dates back to John Locke and still persists today in modern schools of thought.
I was drawn towards this topic because I often find that people, especially
young people, are drawn towards policy and form their opinions based on the
intentions of the policy rather than its actual, measurable, effects. I'm
leaning towards a research paper or a video for a final product. A research
paper is always a solid choice. I could also see myself presenting several
examples of unintended consequences in the form of a bunch of minute-long
animated clips with a voice over.
