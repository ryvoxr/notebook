The article was an update on inflation in the US economy. The section of the
article I focused on was the part about the average interest rate for a 30-year
mortgage. The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage increased to 6.88%.
From another page on the same site, the standard deviation of mortgage rates is
presented to be approximately 0.5%.

*Couldn't find n. For the sake of the assignment using n=100.*

T-Interval
mean: 6.8
SD: 0.5
n: 100
C-level: 0.95
(6.781, 6.979)

We are 95% confident that the true mean of mortgage interest rates is between
6.781% and 6.979%.
