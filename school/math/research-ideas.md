# Research Ideas

I type a lot and I type pretty fast. I'm planning on going into CS. I wonder
how intended major (or field) relates to typing speed. Maybe sample 30 seniors
total, 15 from STEM and 15 from humanities. Have each participant do three
typing tests and take the average. Can test to determine if there is enough
evidence to suggest that typing speed changes based on intended field.
Sometimes, when I see people work, I'm astonished at the speed and technique
that people use to type. Given that so much of our work is done on computers,
typing is an integral part of our day to day lives. I would hypothesize that
people who spend more time on computers (STEM majors maybe?) would type faster.
Or maybe those in AP English classes who write a lot would type faster. I'm
curious.
