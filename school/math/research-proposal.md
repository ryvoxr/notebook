# Research Proposal

### Question

How does a Raleigh Charter student's field of study relate with their typing
speed.
- I type a lot and I type pretty fast. I'm planning on going into CS. I wonder
  how intended major (or field) relates to typing speed.
- People might be interested in reading about this to see how they stack up
  speed-wise with others in their major. People might also be interested to see
  what majors are faster typers than others.

### Data

Need to collect typing speed data from individuals across several majors.

Observational study:
- Have 15 seniors from each field complete the same three random typing speed
  tests
- Make inferences from the data (multiple confidence intervals) (NOVA?)
