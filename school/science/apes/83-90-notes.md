# 83-90 Notes

## Natural selection process

Individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce under
a particular set of environmental conditions than those without the traits
- These survival traits would become more prevalent in future populations of
  the species
- Because individuals with those traits become more numerous and pass on genetics

Biological evolution through natural selection has become an important
scientific theory
- Explains how life has changed over the past 3.5 billion years and why life
  is so diverse today

## Speciation process 

Natural selection creating an entirely new species
- One species splits into two or more different species

For sexually reproducing organisms -> new species forms when one population of
a species has evolved to the point where its members can no long breed and
produce fertile offspring with the originals

Occurs when a barrier or distant migration separates two or more pollutions of
a species and prevents the flow of genes between them
- Geographic isolation
- Reproductive isolation

## Geographic isolation

Occurs when different groups of the same population of a species become
physically isolated for a long time
- Maybe migration

## Reproductive isolation

Mutation and change by natural selection operate independently in the gene
pools of geographically isolated populations
- If this occurs long enough, members can become so different that they cannot
  produce live, fertile offspring
