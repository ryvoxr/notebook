# Convection Cells

In gasses (and sometimes fluids and solids), when something warms up
- Molecules spread up
- Become less dense and rise up
- Similar to hot air balloon

## Hadley Cell
Unequal heating at the earth
- Equator gets the most heating
- Air rises
- Slides along, cools and settles at 30 deg N and S


## Land and Sea Breezes

#### Sea Breeze
Happen every day at the ocean
- Warm day
- Everything is heating up
- Water molecules in ocean do not heat up or cool down fast
	-  Hydrogen bonds
- Air on the land rises and air from the ocean comes to replace it

#### Land Breeze
Exact opposite of sea breeze
- At night
- Land cools down
- Ocean stays the same
- Ocean is warmer
- Air on ocean rises and air from the land goes to the ocean
