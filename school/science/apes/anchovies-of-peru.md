# Anchovies of Peru: El Nino weather patterns

*El Nino*

Because of El Nino, there was less upwelling off of the coast of Peru. This
means less nutrients and warmer water.

El Nino's warmer waters and lower nutrients meant less food for the anchovies,
so young anchovies were not able to find enough food and survive.

Anchovies are not able to survive in the warm water because of a decrease in
the food availability
