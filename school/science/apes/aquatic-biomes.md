# Aquatic Biomes

## Oceans

### Ecosystem services

1. Oxygen supplied to organisms via water circulation
2. Water purification by organisms living there
3. Climate moderation
    - Water changes temp -> slowly changes world temp

### Economic Services

Food, energy, pharmaceuticals, harbors/transportation, recreation, tourism,
employment, minerals/mining, freshwater production via desalination

## Wetlands

Land areas saturated and covered with water
- Coastal marshes -> temperate areas -> sea grasses
- Mangroves -> tropical areas -> shrubs/bushes

One of the most productive areas
- Due to river input, tidal mixing, and lots of sunlight

US has lost over 50% of wetlands since 1900
- New Zealand and Italy over 90%
- In the past -> Due to development
- In the future -> Due to sea level change flooding them
