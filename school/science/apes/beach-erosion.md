# Beach Erosion

In ocean waves, the energy is moving
- The particles of water just go in a circle
- As you get closer to the shore, half of the wavelength depth you get dragging
    - The bottom of the wave is touching the bottom
    - The other waves pile up
    - Waves breaking

Wave comes in with a certain wavelength
- If the slope of the beach is flat then it spills many times
- Sometimes the wave crashes all at once
- Smaller waves don't drag as early

Waves come in at angles sometimes
- Carries sand with it and out with it
    - Long-shore drift

We build structures on moving sand
- Barrier islands
- Lots of money and laws in terms of stopping erosion
