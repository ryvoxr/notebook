# Biodiversity

"The variety of life in an ecosystem"

Measured by:
- Species abundance -> the number of individuals per species
- Species richness -> the number of species in an ecosystem

Simpson's diversity Index is a quantitative way of measuring abundance and richness
- A lower number represents higher diversity
