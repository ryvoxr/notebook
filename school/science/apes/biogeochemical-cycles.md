# Biogeochemical cycles

Carbon Cycle -> movement of carbon between sources and sinks
- Carbon sink -> a carbon reservoir that stores more carbon than it releases
    - They mitigate the effects of climate change
    - ex: oceans, photosynthesis
- Carbon source -> processes that release more carbon than they store
    - ex: fossil fuel combustion, animal agriculture, deforestation, cellular respiration

Nitrogen Cycle -> movement of nitrogen between sources and sinks
- Nitrogen fixation -> bacterial fixation and synthetic fixation
    - Nitrogen gas to ammonia
    - Assimilation -> plants and animals taking in nitrogen and using in their body
- Ammonification -> production of ammonia
- Nitrification -> ammonia to nitrates
- Denitrification -> nitrates to nitrogen gas

Phosphorus Cycle -> movement of phosphorus between sources and sinks
- Eutrophication (positive feedback loop)
- No gas components
- Stored in rocks and sediment
- Less common than other nutrients
- Needed for DNA and APT

Water cycle
- Driven by the sun
- Ocean is the largest reservoir
- Transpiration, evaporation, runoff, infiltration

Sulfur cycle
- Found in amino acids
- Released through mining
- Chemosynthesis
- Acid rain
- Found in coal
