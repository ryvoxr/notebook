# Cat drop operation

*Unintended consequences*

1. In Borneo, there was an outbreak of Malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes
2. The World Health Organization steps in and sprays DDT, an insecticide,
   killing the mosquitoes
3. However, DDT also kills a species of wasp that preyed on thatch eating
   caterpillars
4. Many houses had their roofs collapse due to the being eaten by caterpillars
5. The DDT that the World Health Organization sprayed to kill off the
   mosquitoes were also consumed by flies
6. The flies were eaten by geckos, and many geckos began to have high DDT
   levels inside of them
7. Although the geckos were resistant to DDT, the cats that ate them were not
   and began to die
8. With the absence of cats, rats flourished and spread plague throughout the
   island
9. In order to control the rat population, cats have to be air dropped onto the
   island
