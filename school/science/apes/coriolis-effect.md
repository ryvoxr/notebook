# The Coriolis Effect

The deflection of fluids due to the spin on the earth
- Fluids -> air and water
- As you move through the atmosphere, the different speeds cause it to deflect

Speed is different ad different latidues
- Speed at the equator is 1,000 mph
- At 60 deg North it is 500 mph
- Makes the prevailing winds bend
    - Deflect to the right

Spins right in the NH and left in the SH

Also influences currents
- Ends up bending along the coast of the continents
