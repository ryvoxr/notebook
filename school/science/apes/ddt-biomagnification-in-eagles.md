# DDT biomagnification in eagles

*Biomagnification*

DDT used for farmer's plans ran off into nearby streams and rivers. This DDT
was consumed by the little fish, then the larger fish, then the eagles.

Because of the 10% rule, although each small fish had a miniscule amount of DDT
in it, the eagles ate the equivalent of hundreds of little fish worth of DDT.
This is called biomagnification.

The DDT caused the thinning of the eagle's eggshells
