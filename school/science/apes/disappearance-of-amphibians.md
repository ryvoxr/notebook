# Disappearance of amphibians

*Indicator species*

Amphibians are having trouble adapting to rapid changes that have taken place
in their water and land habitats during the past few decades.
- Changes primarily from human activates such as pesticides and other water
  pollutants

33% of all known amphibian species are threatened with extinction
- More than 40% of all known amphibian species are declining

No single cause...but
- Frog eggs have no shells to protect frog embryos from water pollutants
- Adult frogs are often exposed to insecticides contained in the insects they
  eat

Amphibians are sensitive biological indicators of changes in environmental
conditions
- Indicate habitat loss, air and water pollution, UV radiation, and climate
  change

Adult amphibians plan important ecological roles in biological communities
- Amphibians eat more insects than birds
- The extinction of certain amphibian species could lead to extinction of other
  amphibians
