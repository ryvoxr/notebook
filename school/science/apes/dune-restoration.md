# Dune Restoration

Dunes are a natural barrier between ocean and sea
- Provide sand supply
- Habitat for specialized shore species
- Protection from storm, tsunami, and wind-blown sand

Dune is the "backstop" of the beach sand cycle

Dunes are formed when wind-blown sand is stopped by special plants
- Storm waves scour toe of the dune
- Forms a new ramp

## Dune Plants

Recovery can only happen in the presence of two special dune plants: Spinifex and pingao
- Have deep well developed root systems that bind the sand deposits
- Thrive on unstable stand
- Are adapted to the harsh coastal environment

Spinifex:
- Have long trailing runners -> stolons
    - Can grow up to 8m per year

Other dune plants are on the backside of the dunes

## Human effects

Dunes have been greatly disturbed and extensivley modified
- Cleared of native vegetation
    - Causes wind erosion
    - Replanted with exotic speccies -> marram grass

Dunes have been used for farming and pine plantations

Encroached by civilization (buildings, parking lots, etc)

Very few natural dunes remain

## Restoration

Restoring the dunes will help protect the land and environment and cities and infrastructures

Dunes do not prevent erosion
- They are naturally self repearring
- Eroding and recovring
- Moving with the shoreline

### Assesment

Combine local, expert, and historical data and knowledge

### Planning

Determine the natural materials required
- Plants and stuff

### Physical work

Terraforming to restore the natural shape of the dune
- Or to remove dense exotic vegetation

Other infrastructure
- Planting plants
- Sings and fencing
- Accessways

### Long term commitment

Maintaing and monitoring the dunes
