# El Nino

During El Nino, trade winds weaken

Warm water is pushed ack east, toward the west coast of the Americas

Areas in the northern US and Canada are dryer and warmer than Usual, but the
Gulf Coast and southeast are wetter 

During normal conditions, upwelling occurs. Without the uwpelling their are
fewer phytoplankton off the coasts
- This affects fish that eat phytoplankton

Fisheries in Peru suffer greatly from El Nino
