# Farming and Forestry

## Feedlots (CFOS)

Confined feeding operation
- Used for many animals (cattle)

## Synthetic Pesticide

Man made chemicals
- Used in agriculture and farming

## Crop Rotation

Planting different crops at different times on the same area
- Optimize nutrients and combat weeds
- Increases biodiversity

## Community Gardens

Piece of land gardened or cultivated by a group of people

## Prescribed Burns

Fires set intentionally for the purpose of fire management, farming, or prairie
reconstruction
- Lowers the risk of dangerous fires

## Biological Pest Control

Reduction of pest population
- Predators eat the pest
- Parasites lay eggs on the pest
- Pathogens cause disease to the target
- Competitors out compete the pest
- Eliminates the need for chemical pesticides

## Vertical Farms

Most commonly seen in urban areas where large scale farming can not be used

## Genetically Modified BT Corn

Created by adding a gene into the DNA of a corn plant
- Helps the corn plant gain pest protection and better quality

## Contour Farming and Terracing

Sloped land is cultivated in order to catch and conserve rainwater
- Erosion control, improved soil fertility

## Tree Farms

Forests planted for high wood production
- Reduce runoff

## Clear Cutting

Forest felling where almost all of the trees are removed
- Strip cutting => trees cut at right angle to prevailing winds
- Timber harvesting
- Forest regeneration

## Irrigation

Bring water through man made ways to crops
- Surface, sprinkler, micro/drip

## Hydroponics/Aquaponics

Hydroponics => growing plants without soil
- Less water, no soil issues
Aquaponics => Aquaculture + Hydroponics
- Nutrient rich aquaculture water feeds fish

## Rotational Grazing

Move livestock around to improve soil, plant, and animal health
- Increases productivity but expensive

## Soil Salinization

Salt accumulates in the soil
- Affects biodiversity, productivity, and environmental health
