Confined animal feeding operations

Concentrated in Great Plains, Corn Belt, Southwest/Midwest/Pacific NW regions

Increase the amount of fat in animals as fast as possible

Animals kept in confined operations arenâ€™t allowed to move around

Eat a diet of mostly grain (corn or soy)

Year-round grazing is not possible, so feed lots take less time to raise cows

Fewer carbon emissions

Can cause water and air pollution from manure

Runoff can cause eutrophication and dead zones

Question of the health of animals and quality of work for workers

Questionable standards
