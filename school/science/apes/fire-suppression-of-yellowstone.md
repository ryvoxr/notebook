# Fire suppression of Yellowstone

*Environmental justice*

Park required to protect developed parts of the park and human life in the case
of the fire but also supposed to let fires carry out their ecological role as
much as possible

One flank may be suppressed to protect people while another may be left to burn

Fire suppression can damage the environment and diminish biodiversity

Parks burning have demonstrated secondary succession
