# Flint water crisis

*Environmental justice*

Flint Michigan; 2014

Contamination and poverty

When the city of Flint switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River for
water in an effort to save money, people began to get sick because the pipes in
the Flint river contained lead, and the water was contaminated.

Flint could not afford to fix the popes or remain connected to the Detroit Water System.

This disaster shows how money and poverty plays a big role in public and
environmental health
