# Great barrier reef bleaching

The formation of coral reefs are the result of a mutualistic relationship
between polyps (tiny animals) and zooxanthellae (single-celled algae)

Algae supplies food and oxygen to the reef and gives it its color

Pollution & warm water cause algae to die

Coral polyps die, leaving behind a white skeleton of calcium carbonate
