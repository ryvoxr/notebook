# Lionfish invasion: NC coastline

Lionfish originally from the Indo-Pacific

Released on the coast of NC, Bahamas, and FL

Issues: eats the same prey as groupers and trout (in extreme amounts),
reproduce very fast, no natural predators, venomous

Solution: hunting, competitions to see who can kill the most, population grows
too fast for them to be eradicated, found ways to eat lionfish
