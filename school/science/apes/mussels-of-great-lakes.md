# Mussels of great lakes

*Invasive species*

Mussels: invasive species

The mussels are introduced through ballast water

They filter out a type of phosphorus, letting algae grow 

Because they filter the water, the water becomes clearer meaning sunlight can
reach further down into the lakes, and the algae can then grow deeper
