# Ocean acidification

Caused by increased CO2 emissions from human activities (such as burning fossil fuels)
- dissolves into carbonic acid

If pH drops then carbonate decreases
- needed by shell organisms to make their shells

Zooxanthellae lost from the corals, causing the corals to lose color and
habitat lost for those that lives in the coral reefs
