# Pacific garbage patch

Debris in Northern Pacific ocean bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre

Consist of an Eastern and Western Patch, one on the Japan side, one closer to
America

Convergence zone where warmer South pacific water meets cool Northern arctic
water, creating a highway for debris between the two patches

Mostly made up of microplastics making it less of a patch then a soup

Lots of debris also sinks so the ocean floor may also be littered with trash

Too big to trawl, hard to find a solution without also killing a lot of
wildlife

Microplastics build up in sea life over time, extremely harmful, can block
light from phytoplankton or algae, throwing food web off balance

Since completely cleaning up the garbage patch seems unlikely and extremely
costly, raises the question of how we can reduce the amount of plastic in our
oceans in the future and what steps need to be taken
