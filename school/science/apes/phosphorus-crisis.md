# Phosphorus crisis

World is running low on phosphorus 

Maybe 90 years left globally, US has 40 years left of phosphorus use

Mainly used in fertilizers for agriculture

Morocco holds most phosphorus reserves in the world, US supply located in Florida

Looking for alternatives to phosphorus/gathering it
