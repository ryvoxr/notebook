# Plate tectonics

Alfred Wegener:
- Different continents tend to fit together like a puzzle
- First person to say that all of the plates were connected at one point
- Thought that the continental plates were pushing through the oceanic plates
  (wrong)

Fossils appeared on other sides of the Atlantic

Magnetic fields stored in the rock
- Can look at the polarity of the rock itself
- Can determine how old the rock is and how it is moving

The youngest rock is at the center of the ocean
- North America and Eurasia have been pulled apart
- New oceanic crust has been made in the middle

Can look at where earthquakes occur
- Earthquakes are centered along the mid-oceanic ridge and the ring of fire
- Along the plates

Two types of plates:
1. Continental plates
- Made of granite
- Granite is a lighter rock and less dense than oceanic plates
2. Oceanic plates
- Made of basalt
- Denser, darker rock

Oceanic plate goes underneath the continental plate


## Boundaries

Two continental crusts converging
- Continental ridge

Two continental crusts diverging
- Continental ridge

Two oceanic plates converging
- Volcanism in the ocean

Two oceanic plates diverging
- Sea floor spreading

Transform boundary
- Earthquakes


## Hot spots

Magma comes up from the astenosphere
