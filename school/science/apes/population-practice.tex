\subsection{What would the change in population for this country be in the year
2021 based solely on immigration and emigration?}

\begin{gather}
    C = 1.8*10^7 * 0.3\% \\
    C = 54000 \\
\end{gather}

\subsection{What is the 2020 population growth rate in terms of percent for
this country?}

\begin{gather}
    Gr = \frac{change}{init} + k \\
    change = \left(\frac{1.8*10^7 \ people}{1}\right) \left(\frac{16\ births - 4\ deaths}{1000\ people}\right) = 2.16*10^5 \ people \\
    init = 1.8 * 10^7 \ people \\
    Gr = \frac{2.16*10^5}{1.8 * 10^7} + 0.3\% \\
    Gr = 1.5\%
\end{gather}

\subsection{What was the population growth rate over the past 35 years for this
country?}

\begin{gather}
    Gr = \frac{change}{init} \\
    change = 1.8 * 10^7 - 9 * 10^6 = 9 * 10^6 \ people \\
    Gr = \frac{9 * 10^6}{9 * 10^6} \\
    Gr = 100\%
\end{gather}

\subsection{What is the population density of the country considering only land
that can be lived on by people?}

\begin{gather}
    D_p = \frac{N}{A} \\
    D_p = \frac{1.8 * 10^7\ people}{0.6*4000\ mi^2} \\
    D_p = 7500\ \frac{people}{mi^2}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Based on the population growth rate you calculated for 2020, how
many years would it take to reach 72 million people?}

\begin{gather}
    P = P_0 * e^{rt} \\
    7.2 * 10^7 = 1.8 * 10^7 * e^{0.012 * t} \\
    0.012 * t = \ln{\left(\frac{7.2 * 10^7}{1.8 * 10^7}\right)} \\
    t = 115.53\ years
\end{gather}

\subsection{How many births were there in 2020?}

\begin{gather}
    births = 1.8 * 10^7\ people * \left(\frac{16\ births}{1000\ people}\right) \\
    2.88 * 10^5\ births
\end{gather}

\subsection{How many infants died in 2020?}

\begin{gather}
    deaths = 2.88 * 10^5\ infants * \left(\frac{24\ deaths}{1000\ infants}\right) \\
    6912\  infant\ deaths
\end{gather}

\subsection{How many people were added in 2020 to the countries}

\begin{equation}
    1.88 * 10^5\ births - 6912\ deaths = 1.86 * 10^5\ new\ people
 \end{equation}

\subsection{IF this population was 15 million 10 years ago, what was the
percent change from 2010 to 2020?}

\begin{gather}
    C = \frac{change}{init} \\
    change = 1.8 * 10^7 - 1.5 * 10^7 = 3 * 10^6 \\
    C = \frac{3 * 10^6}{1.5 * 10^7} \\
    C = 20\%
\end{gather}
