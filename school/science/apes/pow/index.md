Topic: Energy efficiency

Question: How much total electrical energy do I use every day and how low can I
make that number?

Setup:
1. Every time I encounter a new electrical device, record its wattage
2. Create a spreadsheet or other program that allows easy addition of energy
   entries

Experiment:
1. For one week, record all usage of electrical devices
2. Attempt to reduce this number as much as possible
3. Analyze results

What is counted as a device?
- Any electrical item which I use/benefit from for a non-negligible period of
  time, percentage of use, or power draw
- Ex: computer, lights in room or at school, oven for dinner, etc
- Counter ex: lights in the hallway at school, street lights

How much of each device is counted?
- Item in my room   -> 100% of consumption
- Item I own        -> 100% of consumption
- Household item    -> 25% of consumption
- Class item        -> 5% of consumption
