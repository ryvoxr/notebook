## Henry Oehlrich -> Bioethanol Fuel (34s)

Hello! For my power of one project I made bioethanol fuel.

Goal was to make a bunch of ethanol for use as fuel in my lawnmower Frank

Main inspiration for this project was the guest speaker
- Came in a week and a half ago
- Spoke about ethanol and biofuel
- He said that you could make it in your garage
- So I made it in my garage

I'll talk about impact throughout the presentation

## Resource Collection (33s)

For this project I needed to create two things
1. Device for fermentation
2. A still

All the materials were used or broken
- Only things I bought new were the coil and the fittings

The source material for the fermentation is fruit
- Gathered 48lbs total of rotten fruit
- Can ask supermarkets for rotten fruit and they will sell it to you for nearly
  free
- Asked my neighbors for rotting fruit (which is a really awkward conversation
  to have)

## Mashing and Ripples (40s)

## Fermentation (40s)

## Still Engineering (39s)

## Distillation ()

After the fermentation is done you need to distill the biomaterial
- Did this for 12 hours straight on Monday

Before distilling you first had to strain the liquid because it was too chunky

Distillation surprisingly worked after minor hiccups in the beginning
