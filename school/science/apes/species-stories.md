# Species Stories

## Overview

Stoneflies -> Indicator species for water quality
Seastars -> First keystone species, proponent of biodiversity and population control
Rats in the Galapagos -> Invasive species that stopped the population growth of giant tortoises
Ants and acacia trees -> Symbiotic relationship, trees give food and water, ants protect tree
Mistletoe and trees -> Parasitic relationship, mistletoe grows on tree and takes nutrients and water
Lichen and air quality -> Indicator species, sensitive to environment, pollution can cause death
Lionfish -> Invasive species, no natural predators, eats other fish, US east coast
Honeybees -> Keystone species, required to pollinate plants, removal can cause big trophic cascade
Beavers in mountain streams -> Keystone species, create dams, reduce erosion and flooding
Coral and Zooxanthellae -> Mutualistic relationship, Zooxanthellae are algae living in coral provides nutrients
Barnacles on a rocky shore -> Resource partitioning, different types of barnacles are at different heights
Anopheles mosquito and Plasmodium -> Parasitic relationship, mosquitoes carry plasmodium around after being infected
Loggerhead sea turtle -> Endangered species, victim to bycatch loss of habitat and pollution
Brassica genus -> Artificial selection, mustard plants bred for specific traits
Cladohora and Zebra -> Invasive species mussels filter water
Anole lizards in Puerto Rico -> Resource partitioning, different types of lizards coexist by eating different things
Prairie dogs -> Keystone species, provide food, create habitats, clip vegetation
Cows -> Artificial selection, breed cows for desirable traits
Mountain Gorilla -> Endangered species, one of the most endangered species in the world
Burmese Python -> Invasive species, top predator, caused the decrease in other species


## In-class notes

### Stone flies => indicator Species
- Good water quality if they are present

### Sea Stars in a Tidal Pool => One of the first keystone species
- Population control
- Proponent of biodiversity and upheld ecosystem
- Keystone species

### Rats in the Galapagos
- Invasive species in the Galapagos
- Stopped the population growth of giant tortoises

### Ants and acacia trees
- Mutualistic symbiotic relationship
- Ants protect the acacia tree
- Evolve skills to protect each other
- Ants can detect vibrations from herbivores eating the plants

### Mistletoe in trees
- Parasitic relationship
- Mistletoes benefits
- Grows on the host
- Can spread due to birds

### Lichen and air quality
- Indicator species: sensitive to environment
- Protect sensitive ecological areas
