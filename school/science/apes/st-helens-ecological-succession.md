# Mount St Helens ecological succession

Some plants and animals were able to survive the blast (fish in frozen lakes,
gophers in holes, plants and trees with protected roots, etc.) though many
could not survive the extreme conditions, would play a large role in succession
and reseeding the ground

Wind blew in seeds and insects

Birds, deer and elk attracted by plants and insects and brought more seeds

Some ponds and streams created by eruption would help foster new life

Took 20 years for plant coverage to reach 2/3 of the land

Nitrogen fixing plants like the lupine helped restore nutrients to the volcanic
soil

As creatures/insects/plants died and decayed they also helped restore soil
nutrients

Led to better understanding of the processes of succession 

May take hundreds of years for the ecosystem to be restored to its original
health
