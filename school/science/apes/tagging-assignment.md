# Tagging Assignment

There were literally only two places that hadn't been fully done.

I tagged animals in Lewa (Kenya)

It started out with a bunch of mid-sized mammals with horns.

About ten minutes in, there was an elephant (a-lay-fant), very cool
- The next 10 videos were just the elephant moving across the screen
    - This elephant was very slow
- A few minutes later, his buddy, another elephant joined in
- They were vibing in the middle of the screen for literally the rest of the
  time
