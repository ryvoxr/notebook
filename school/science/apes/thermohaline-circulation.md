# Thermohaline Circulation

Heat on one side, no head on the other side
- Water circulates
- On the top on the warm side
- On the bottom onthe coldside

Global conveyer-belt of water
- Very rarely do the surface and the deep water mix
- Thermocline between them
- Mixes every 1000 years
    - Can test because of CFC's

Water does mix at the poles
- Water is cold and sinks
- Climate change might make a warm-cold water barrier in the arctic
