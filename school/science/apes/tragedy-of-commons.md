# Tragedy of Commons

Commons are resources or areas that are open to many people

Garret Hardin
- Considered situations where we must share a common resource
- Situations pitch short term self interest against the common good

Lets an individual benefit him or himself while spreading out the negative consequences among everyone.
- Optimizing for the self in the short term is not good for everyone in the long term

Examples
- Coal power plant -> good short-term benefits, spreads pollution into the air
- Deforestation
- Bottled water
