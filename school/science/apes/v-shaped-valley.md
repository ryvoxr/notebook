# V shaped valley

*Water runoff and nutrients*

Goal was to compare the loss of water and soil nutrients from an area of uncut
forest  with a treeless area

Built V-shaped concrete dams across creeks at the bottoms of forested valleys

Dams designed so surface water leaving each forested valley had to flow across
a dam where scientists could measure volume + dissolved nutrients

Measured these things and found that undisturbed forests were efficient at
storing water and retaining chemical nutrients in its soils

They set up an experimental forest and cut down all the trees + sprayed with
herbicide 

Scientists found that with no plants to help absorb + retain water, the water
flowing out increased by 30-40%

It ran over the ground and eroded soil + carried nutrients out
