# Vanishing Amphibians

## Describe the threats to many of the worldâ€™s amphibian species.

1. Frog eggs have no shells to protect from embryos from water pollutants
2. Adult frogs are often exposed to insecticides contained in the many insects they eat
3. 33% of all known amphibian species are threatened with extinction
4. More than 40% are declining

## How might we and other species be affected if all amphibians were to go extinct? 

Amphibians are an indicator species, so we wouldn't have that

Less biodiversity and fewer animals in total
- The things that primarily eat amphibians would have to adapt or just die
- We would have less food because there would be fewer animals

Could lead to the extinction of other species -> reptiles, birds, fish and mammals

## What major ecological role do many amphibian species play? 

They are an indicator species
- Indicate environmental conditions such as habitat loss, air and water
  pollution, ultraviolet radiation, and climate change

## Explain why we should avoid hastening the extinction of any amphibian species through our activities. 

All the bad things described in #2 would happen

We would lose amphibians compounds that could be used for pharmaceuticals

Extinction of any amphibian species would likely lead to other extinctions

## Are amphibians keystone species, indicator species, invasive species, or endangered species? Which ones are true, how many?

They are indicator species, and I believe that a few species are endangered
