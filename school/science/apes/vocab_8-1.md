Rocky mountain front
    Mountains meeting the plains

Ecotone
    Transition area between two biological communities

No till farming
    Technique for growing crops without disturbing the soil through tilling.
    Decreases the amount of soil erosion.

Polyculture
    Growing more than one species of plant in the same space. Attempts to mimic
    the diversity in natural ecosystems.

Dust bowl
    Period of severe dust storms that greatly damadged the ecology and
    agriculture of American and Canadian plains.

Root channels
    Pores fromed by plants roots. Water flow in root channels is an important
    mechanism of infiltration in soil.

Cover crops
    Crops that are planted to cover the soil rather than to be harvested. They
    prevent soil erosion.

Leaching
    Loss of water-soluble plant nutrients from the soil, due to rain and
    irrigation.

Soil
    Mixture of air, water, minerals, nutrients, and humus.

Salinization
    Soil becoming more salty because when the water evaporates the salt is left
    behind.

Compaction
    Soil particles being pressed together, reducing pore space between them.
    Reduces infiltration.

Acidity/Mineral availability
    Soil acidity decreases the availability of soil nutrients and minerals.

Desertification
