# Coastal welling

Because of Ekaman Transport, water moves perpendicular to the direction of the air

## Upwelling

### Coastal Upwelling

Water gets pulled back from the coast 
- Dead stuff in the water rises
- Lots of nutrients

### Equatorial Upwelling

Easterly winds pull the water away from the equator
- Pull of nutrient rich water from the ocean bottom
