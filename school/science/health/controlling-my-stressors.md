# Controlling My Stressors

**Identify five stressors that you are currently facing. For each of these
stressors list three positive coping strategies. These coping strategies may
include ways to avoid the stressor, or ways to minimize the stressor, or ways
to deal with the stressor.**

### My car broke down (and is unfixable) and now It's difficult for me to get around and do things

1. Work to salvage the old car and buy another one to solve the problem
2. Create a plan with friends and family to temporarily rely on them for transit
3. Make friends on the bus (cause I have to ride that now)

### I've got this gap between my pectoral muscles and it bugs me a lot

1. Work to gain some more muscle and fat so it's not as noticeable
2. Be grateful and happy for my otherwise good muscle insertions
3. Pose at a 45 degree angle so it looks better

### Not sure how some of my college deferrals are going to turn out

1. Think about the places I've already gotten into
2. Realise that NC State's gym is probably too busy to be good anyways and
   Colorado School of Mines' is probably empty so I can just go there instead
   and have at least one thing better than State
3. Color to relax me

### I want to do cool physics but I don't know enough math

1. Learn more math
2. Accept that cool physics is reserved for a special few and retire back to
   computer science
3. Go for a walk

### I want to be bigger but the number on the scale isn't going up

1. Push the food harder
2. Be happy with the fact that I'm lean with zero effort and some people try
   really hard to lose fat
3. Remember that everyone I've talked to about this has said I don't actually
   need to be bigger
