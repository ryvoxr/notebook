# Empathy HW

**Describe a situation in your life where you could have used empathy to
respond. Recall the scenario and elaborate on what your empathic response could
have been in the moment.**

On Friday last week, Ansh's girlfriend broke up with him. In physics he was
looking really down and not talking. In the moment, I didn't say anything in
fear of upsetting him further or being annoying. I think that choosing not to
say anything, from a perspective of how I would like to be treated in that
situation, is a form of empathy. I could have also briefly and quietly said:
"That sucks man, I know how that feels. I'm here for you.". I think they're
back together now, so he's all good.
