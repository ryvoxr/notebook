Write three bullet points to disprove the following myths about mental health:

1. Children don't experience mental health problems
- 1 in 10 children and young people aged 5-16 suffer from a diagnosable mental
  health disorder - that's around three children in every class
- 1 in 12 young people self-harm
- 75% of young people with a mental health problem are not receiving treatment

2. Social phobias only relate to public speaking fears
- Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by overwhelming anxiety
  and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations.
- Social phobia can be limited to only one type of situation - such as a fear
  of speaking in formal or informal situations, or eating or drinking in front
  of others - or, in its most severe form, may be so broad that a person
  experiences symptoms almost anytime they are around other people.
- Social phobia can be very debilitating - it may even keep people from going
  to work or school on some days.

3. Hoarding isn't a mental health condition
- Hoarding is a mental health disorder characterized by a persistent difficulty
  discarding or parting with possessions because of a perceived need to save
  them.
- A person with hoarding disorder experiences distress at the thought of
  getting rid of the items. Excessive accumulation of items, regardless of
  actual value, occurs.
- Hoarding often creates such cramped living conditions that homes may be
  filled to capacity, with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of
  clutter. Some people also collect animals, keeping dozens or hundreds of pets
  often in unsanitary conditions.

4. Adolecents cannot suffer from PTSD
- PTSD can occur at any age, including childhood.
- Symptoms of PTSD may start soon after a traumatic event and then continue.
  Other people develop new or more severe symptoms 6 or more months after the
  event.
- Symptoms of PTSD may disrupt a person's life and make it hard to continue
  with daily activities.
