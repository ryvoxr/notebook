# 16 Questions

## 1. Adaptations

**Explain at least 5 adaptations of different animals that have allowed them to
be successful in the ocean. (Be specific with name of adaptation, the animal,
and how it specifically helps the organism)**

Fish -> Move in schools, hive mind almost
- Confuse the predator (can't make a choice)
- Most of the fish will survive (the predator will get satisfied eventually)

Octopus -> Camouflage
- Hide from predators

Humpback whale -> Bubble feeding
- Able to eat many fish at one time
- Basically how they get sustenance

## 2. Oysters

**Explain how Oysters are a keystone species of the Chesapeake**

While eating, oysters clean an filter the water. This traps and removes
particles of food as well as nutrients.

Oysters prevent eutrophication.

## 3. Groin

**Explain the effect of a groin on a beach. (Use key terms: AT LEAST 5)**

Groins are a method of hard stabilization that is used to catch sand for your
beach. Longshore drift, being the river of sand, moves the sand along the
coastline; groins catch this sand and prevent it from moving on. This increases
the amount of sand on the beach on one side of the groin, but decreases the
amount on the other side. Because of this, it is common to sea many groins in
sequence, each collecting sand for a portion of the beach.

## 4. El Nino

**Explain the many effects of El Nino on the waters of the Eastern Pacific off
from the coasts of Peru and S. California**

During El Nino, the trade winds weaken.

For fisheries in Peru, this is disastrous. Under normal conditions, large
amounts of upwelling take place on the western coast of Peru; during El
Nino, however, upwelling occurs far less. This results in less nutrients
making the fisheries (anchovies in particular suffer).

During an El Nino event, sea surface temperatures over the central and eastern
Pacific ocean increase (and the western temperatures decrease).

The weaker trade winds lead to drier weather over the western Pacific, and
wetter weather over the eastern pacific.

## 5. Estuaries

**Discuss estuaries, their importance, and the role of sea grasses and mangroves
in these areas.**

Estuaries are the tidal mouths of large rivers. Here, there is a mixture of
salt and freshwater creating important places for nesting and breeding. Because
of the niche conditions of estuaries, there is a ton of life, but very low
biodiversity.

Sea grasses and mangroves provide the primary producers for estuaries.


## 6. Phytoplankton

**Describe phytoplankton, zooplankton, and nekton and their relationships to each
other and upwelling and eutrophication**

Plankton are crucial parts of the marine food web. The produce oxygen, biomass,
and nutrients. Plankton be floaters.

Zooplankton can be considered plankton... But, they also eat plankton.

Nekton are active swimmers. Nekton eat plankton, zooplankton, or other nekton.

When upwelling occurs, more nutrients, and thus more plankton, mix with the
surface water. This allows nekton (fish) and other things to feed; it increases
productivity.


## 7. CO2

**Explain how the current CO2 increase is unique in what is happening today
with climate change and several of the changes that are occurring due to this
increase in CO2.**

For the first time, human innovation is the cause of carbon dioxide increasing.

280ppm to 420ppm over the past 50 years.

This results in sea level rise, arctic amplification, loss of biodiversity,
acid precipitation, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, irregular weather,
coastline changes, etc.

Since the late 1800s human beings have been wholly dependent of fossil
fuels. This increased the greenhouse effect resulting in a warmer global
temperature.


## 8. NW Passage and Sea Ice

**Discuss the controversy involving sea ice, internal and territorial waters,
global warming, and the NW passage including the countries involve and their
concerns.**

The Northwest passage is a recently opened way between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans located in the Northwest in the arctic. Because of global warming, as
the arctic melts, the northwest passage opens up more.

Because of the ambiguities that exist between internal and territorial waters,
the politics around the northwest passage are very complex. Countries such as
Canada, Greenland, Denmark, the US, and even Russia, all have an involvement
and a claim on the Northwest passage.

Canada, being the closest and feeling the most effect, does not want other
countries to ship through the northwest passage. They cargo ships pollute,
bring invasive species, and break ice.

## 9.

**Discuss the importance of ice melting to sea level, include numbers, which
areas are having the most effect now, and which areas potentially will have the
greatest effect in the future.**

Ice melting contributes significantly, but not completely to sea level rise. As
of 2010, the sea level as risen 20mm due to land ice. 

Although Greenland and Antarctic ice is still important, around 50% of the sea
level rise comes from mountain glaciers.

Greenland will potentially have the greatest effect in the future.

## 10. Plastic

**Discuss plastic and give several reasons why it is a concern for now and in the
future.**

Plastic is a product of oil, made from Naptha produced through fractional
distillation.

Plastic is a major concern now because...
- Disposable economy -> In the 70's and 80's a disposable economy emerged
  because people found that it was cheaper to use a cheap thing once than an
  expensive thing
- Takes a long time do decompose -> Anywhere from 3 months to half a millennia
- Difficult to recycle or dispose of properly -> Different grades of plastic,
  bad plastic has to be sorted out

## 11. Sewage Treatment

**Explain the process of sewage treatment including terminology, the three levels
of treatment, and the overall goal and importance of it.**

Primary treatment
1. Sewage is pumped to the facility
2. Grit chambers remove big things
3. Water enters as sewage

Secondary treatment
1. Uses bacteria to convert ammonia to nitrates
2. Then Nitrites
3. Then N_2
4. Bacteria absorb the phosphorus (become bloated)
5. Sludge is removed
6. Sludge is stored

Tertiary treatment
1. Kill bacteria by filtering or with chlorine
2. Aerates by running over rocks
3. Effluent water leaves the facility

## 12. Upwelling

**Describe upwelling and how it happens and its effects  1) at the equator, 2) on
the coasts**

Equatorial upwelling:
- Due to Ekman transport, trade winds pull the water away from the equator
- Cold, nutrient-rich water takes its place
- Creates strip of very high productivity at the equator

Coastal upwelling:
- Due to Ekman transport, winds pull water away from the coastline
- Cold, nutrient-rich water takes its place
- The magnitude varies based upon environmental and water conditions
- Is affected by El Nino and La Nina differently in different places

## 13. Arctic amplification

**Explain Arctic amplification including key changes and terms and why it is
different in the Arctic.**

Arctic amplification is a positive feedback loop that occurs in the arctic.

1. The sun hits the ice, some is absorbed and some is reflected
2. This heats up and melts some of the ice
3. This melting of ice increases the albedo (reflectivity) of the surface
   making more light be absorbed

## 14. Bathymetry

**Describe the history of bathymetry from past to present.**

1. People looked with their eyeballs at the water to determine how deep it is
2. People dropped ropes with heavy things off of boats to measure depth
3. Used explosions and the time the sound took to return to measure depth
4. SONAR shoots sound at the ocean to determine depth
5. Satellites can be used to map the seabed
6. Multibeam systems - echo sounders (most recent)

## 15. Direct and inverse relationships

**Give an example of direct and two inverse relationships from this course.
Give the two variables that are connected and indicate what happens to variable
B when Variable A goes up.**

Sea level rise varies directly with ocean temperature

Ocean temperature varies indirectly with depth

Sea ice extent varies indirectly with the time difference to winter.

The speed of sound varies directly with density of the medium

## 16. Convection cell

**Explain what a convection cell is and how it is related to trade winds, plate
tectonics, and sea breezes.**
