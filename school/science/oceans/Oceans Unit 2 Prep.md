# Oceans Unit 2 Prep

#### 1. From the cold stunning of turtles article:  explain what cold stunning is and why it happens including characteristics of the gulf stream and water nearby and how these characteristics play a role.
Cold stunning is when sea turtles, too busy gorging themselves on food by the
shoreline, do not return to the Gulf Streams warmer water quickly enough. When
a cold spell hits, the turtles become to lethargic to move. The Gulf stream
provides upwelling to the east cost of the US. This upwelling results in large
amounts of nutrients which the turtles are feeding on.

#### 2. Name the three factors that play a role in establishing geostrophic currents of
1. Continents funnel water in a circle
2. Coriolis makes the water spin to the right in North and left in South so
   pushes water to the middle of the ocean
3. Hill of water builds up so Coriolis ends up pushing water around the hill of
   water in the center of the ocean

#### 3. Explain how equatorial upwelling occurs.
Trade winds pull the water away from the equator. This causes nutrients from
the bottom to rise to the top (mixing). This mixing causes big floral and algae
blooms (biodiversity).

#### 4. Name the 4Rs and how they would be used in terms of plastic, include real life examples and how they illustrate each R.
1. Refuse (don't buy plastic things; instead, use paper alternatives)
2. Reduce (use less plastic)
3. Reuse (repurpose plastic you would otherwise throw away)
4. Recycle (put plastic in the recycling bin)

#### 5. Name and explain four different ways ocean currents are measured in terms of location and speed.
1. Buoys are used to measure ocean currents. The location of the buoy can both
   show where the current is, and can be used to calculate velocity.
2. Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with an ADCP. Can calculate the
   speed of currents by using sound, specifically an acoustic Dopple current
   profiler (ADCP). Unlike sonar, the ADCP is looking for a change in frequency
   instead of just return time. The change in frequency can be used to
   calculate how fast the water is moving.
3. Argo float
4. Swallow float
5. GIS (makes maps)
6. GPS (locates the currents)
7. Current meter
8. Drogue (thing you pull behind a parachute)

#### 6. Explain what the Sargasso sea is, how it is formed, and what importance this area has to ocean wildlife.
The Sargasso sea is a patch of floating (living) seaweed in the North Atlantic
Gyre. This is strange because this part of the ocean is particularly lacking in
nutrients. This patch of sea grass is the place that salmon lay there eggs, and
eels live their lives. Unfortunately, the Atlantic Garbage Patch is located in
roughly the same area. A foundation has been made to help protect this habitat.

#### 7. Explain the disposable economy concept and list three ways it could harm the environment.
The disposable economy is an economy where people buy things only to last a
short while before they "dispose" of them. This is harmful to the environment:
1. An increase of trash output pollutes and clutters both the land and ocean
2. Many disposable are made of plastic. Naptha (chemical to create plastic) is
   created from oil before being turned into plastic. We have relatively little
   oil left in the world and extracting it is becoming more costly and
   environmentally hazardous.

#### 8. Describe how the Hadley cell and trade winds are formed including the terms density, unequal heating, coriolis, and coriolis effect in the answer.
Convection cells (including the Hadley cell) are created by the temperature
changes of air. Warm, low density air rises, moves along the "top", sinks, then
moves along the "bottom" until it warms up again. Convection cells on the earth
form because of unequal heating. The trade winds are the effect of the coriolis
effect on the convection cell's of the world. Because of the unequal speed of
spinning at the surface, air and water go to the right in the northern
hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere

#### 9. Explain the concepts: “tragedy of the commons” and “think globally and act locally” as they relate to the N. Pacific Garbage patch.
 The tragedy of the commons is the result of what happens when an easily
 accessible resource is shared among members of a community. When this is the
 case, members of a community often choose to sacrifice the greater good for
 immediate personal gain (i.e. catching more than your one allotted fish.
 "Think globally and act locally" means that people should consider the large,
 "global" environmental issues and act to fix them "locally" in their
 community.
