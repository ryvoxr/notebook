# E-waste Video Script

Hello everybody and thank you for tuning in to the Environmental Report.

Recent statistics show a strong correlation between the world population and
the amount of e-waste produced.

Increased standards of living and affluence also causes an increase in
electronic products and thus electronic waste.

Pictures just in of nearly a hundred electronic devices sitting idle and unused
at NC school Raleigh Charter.

After speaking with the technology manager there, our team discovered that
these laptops were donated from SAS in full working order because they were
being phased out.

These laptops, unfortunately, are most likely doomed to die because of the
school's strict limits on the devices allowed to be used.

Modern consumer culture, planned obsolescence, and anti-right-to-repair
companies (such as Apple and John Deere) prompt the ever-growing number of
consumers and companies to throw out working tech.
