# NW Passage Lab

1. The NSIDCâ€™s Icelights page discusses various changes that are occurring in
   the Arctic. Click on the article
   https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/arctic-ocean-carbon-sink about carbon
    a. What is a carbon sink?
        - resivor for carbon: plants, trees, the ocean
    b. What is a biological pump?
        - Organisms (biology) moving chemicals -> salmon as a biological pump
    
3. What is one pro and one con about opening up shipping in the NW passage
   according to this reading?  (give on fact/piece of data in the article to
   back up your pro/con)
    - 
        

4. Start Google Earth Google Earth and Choose the Google Earth Ruler tool (on
   left margin, bottom tool). Mouse navigation neeZZds to be on while you draw
   the path from England through the Panama canal to Japan.  Click on spots to
   create a series of lines. NOTE; it costs about $500,000 to go through the
   panama canal.
    a. How long is the shortest route by ship, in kilometers, between England
    and Japan that does not go through the Arctic Ocean? _______km (Use panama
    canal)
   
    b. How long is the shortest route by ship, in kilometers, between northern
    Alaska and New York City through the Panama canal that does not go through
    the Arctic Ocean? _________km
 
    c. repeat your trip from N. Alaska to NY but this time use the Arctic ocean
    (NW passage), how long is this trip? _______km

5. http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/ Look at this daily image
    a. In what month is the sea ice typically at its minimum extent, why is
    this considering the seasons?
 
    b. What was the average (median) sea ice extent for this date from 1979 to
    today? In millions of km2 _______________
 
    c. What is the sea ice extent today in millions of km2? ________________
 

6. Click on first video SVS: 2008 Arctic Sea Ice from AMSR-E (nasa.gov)  what
   happened on Sept 14 that was consequential in terms of traveling through the
   arctic ocean?

6. Jacobshavn glacier https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jakobshavn_retreat-1851-2006.jpg 
What was the rate of glacier recession from 1902 to 2001 in m/day (not km/year) __________
What was the rate of glacier recession from 2001 to 2006 in terms of m/day (not km/year) __________
 
7.  Look at the series of steps involved in an ice shelf breaking up. (BOTTOM OF THIS DOCUMENT).  
Why is this so important?
What three factors are influencing ice shelves breaking up? Be specific as possible

8.  http://www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/content/teacher-materials/impacts-investigation-3.pdf  complete this sea ice analysis: PART 1 ONLY

9. http://www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/impacts/i4-sea-change/exp2-projected.php  complete this

10. Using this data on size of states: List of U.S. states and territories by
    area - Wikipedia
What state would be closest in size to the largest iceberg ever in this article? World's largest iceberg breaks off from Antarctica ice shelf (thenationalnews.com)
Using this chart, between what two states in terms of size, is the size of the larsen A, B, and C ice shelves that have calved off from Antarctica? Used to be 85,000km2 and now is 67,000km2 (NOTE: about 500m thick for the ice shelves, taller than world trade center was)
How many states are larger in size compared to the rest of the Larsen Ice shelf? Not the biggest in Antarctica?
