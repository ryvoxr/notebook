# Intro Notes

"Light is a ray"

Mirror:
- Metal coating on glass
- Coating usually aluminum or silver
- When ray hits the metal, mobile electrons in the metal vibrate at the same
  frequency as the incoming ray. Re-radiates the ray outwards at the same
  frequency
- Glass is there to keep the metal flat and the keep if from oxidizing

Law of Reflection:
- Incoming (incident) angle is theta_i (relative to the tangent)
- Reflection (reflected) angle is at theta_r (relative to the tangent)
- incident = reflected

Reflection types:
- Specular: smooth surface
- Diffuse: bumpy surface

Two mirrors at right angles
- Incoming ray is parallel to outgoing ray
