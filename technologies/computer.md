# Computer

General goals:
- Fast, quick reacting
- Keyboard driven (no cursor, vi bindings)
- No GUI apps
- Small number of keypresses for repeated thing

Macroable functions:
- Open vim in vimwiki
- Enable and disable VPN
- Logout and shutdown
- Select audio i/o and volume

***TODO***
- [ ] Lazy git for vim
- [ ] Non GUI audio manager
- [ ] Migrate away from vimwiki (it's not really needed)
