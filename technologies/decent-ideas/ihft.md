## Le Brainstorming

Can add things that you'd like to do to it:
- maybe take input from vim if you don't specify a name

`ihft -a "read a book"`

When you have free time, you can find the thing you wanted to do before:

`ihft`

Maybe have a time component if you have a small thing that will take a specific
amount of time:

`ihft -a "do a 3x3 ao50" -t 30`
